<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

TO VANCOUVER ISLAND</h2>


<p>From the day I read in the <i>Field</i> Sir Richard
Musgrave's article, "A seventy-pound salmon
with rod and line," and located the river as
the Campbell River, I determined that should
the opportunity arise, I, too, would try my
luck in those waters.</p>

<p>Subsequent articles in the <i>Field</i>, which
appeared from time to time, only increased
my desire, and the summer of 1908 found me
in a position to start on the trip to which I
had so long looked forward.</p>

<p>Living in Egypt, the land of eternal glare
and sunshine, I counted the days till I could
rest my eyes on the ever-green forests of
Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>My intention was to arrive in Vancouver
about the end of July, spend the month of
August, when the great tyee salmon run, at
the Campbell River, and pass September,
when the shooting season begins, in hunting
for wapiti in the primeval forests which clothe
the north of Vancouver Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>I also hoped, should time permit, to have a
try for a Rocky Mountain goat, and possibly
a bear on the Mainland.</p>

<p>I sailed from Southampton on July 10, on
the <i>Deutschland</i>, the magnificent steamer of
the Hamburg-American Line, and never did
I travel in greater luxury.</p>

<p>The voyage across the Atlantic is always
dull and monotonous; it was therefore with
great relief that, having passed Sandy Hook
in the early morning, I found myself approaching
New York on the 16th.</p>

<p>Here I was to have a new experience.</p>

<p>I am, I hope, a modest man, and never
dreamt that I was worthy of becoming the
prey of the American interviewer.</p>

<p>The fact of being a Pasha in Egypt, a rank
which I attained when serving in the Egyptian
Army, was my undoing.</p>

<p>A kind German friend who had used his
good offices on my behalf with the Board of
the Hamburg-American Line, gave the show
away, for I found myself on the printed
passenger list figuring as Sir John Rogers
Pasha.</p>

<p>To the American interviewer, a Pasha was,
I presume, a novelty, and the opportunity of
torturing one not to be forgone, for as soon
as we came alongside the quay at Hoboken, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
pleasant and well-spoken individual came up
to me and, raising his hat, remarked, "The
Pasha I believe. Welcome to America." I
then realized what I was in for.</p>

<p>Had I been a witness in the box, I could
not have undergone a more merciless cross-examination.
It was almost on a par with a
declaration I had to make for the Immigration
Authorities&mdash;giving my age, where I was born,
who were my father and mother, when did
they die, what was the colour of my hair and
eyes, and lastly, had I ever been in prison, and
if so, for what offence?</p>

<p>I really think New York might spare its
visitors this ordeal.</p>

<p>Wriggle as I could, my interviewer was
determined to obtain copy, and though I
insisted that the title of "Pasha" had been
entered on the passenger list by mistake, and
that it was one not intended for exportation,
he was not to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Giving as few details as possible as to how
I had obtained my exalted title, I eventually
shook off my persecutor. No sooner had I
moved a few steps away, than if possible a
more plausible person expressed the great
pleasure it gave him to welcome me to New
York, and endeavoured to impress on me
that it was a duty I owed to myself and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
American nation, not only to explain what
a "Pasha" was and how I became a Pasha,
but also to allow my photograph to be taken,
which he guaranteed would appear the following
day in his paper&mdash;naturally the leading
journal of New York.</p>

<p>On my point-blank refusal to accord any
more interviewers an audience or to be immortalized
in his paper, he sadly expressed his
astonishment that I should refuse the celebrity
he wished to confer on me.</p>

<p>Had not Mr. Kingdon Gould allowed himself
to be photographed?&mdash;then why not I?</p>

<p>Other interviewers gave me up as a bad job,
but just before landing I was leaning over the
side of the steamer when some one shouted,
"I have got you!" and I saw that one of my
persecutors had taken a snapshot, which I am
glad to say must have been a failure, for I did
not appear in the New York papers the next
day.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that one of my interviewers
to whom I had refused any information heaped
coals of fire on my head, by rendering me
valuable assistance in getting my luggage
through the Customs.</p>

<p>I had often heard of the difficulties of the
New York Customs, but I must say I never
met with greater civility, and there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
delay in passing all my baggage, fishing-rods,
guns, rifles, no duty being charged.</p>

<p>New York possessed few attractions for me,
and the call of the Campbell River was strong&mdash;so
July 17th found me starting for Montreal,
where I arrived the same night and put up at
the excellent Windsor Hotel.</p>

<p>Only a top sleeping berth on the Trans-Continental
Express was available for the
following night, and, as I desired a section&mdash;that
is two berths, upper and lower&mdash;I had to
wait till the evening of Sunday, the 19th,
before I could start for Vancouver.</p>

<p>Leaving Montreal at 10.15 p.m., I arrived
at Vancouver about noon on the 24th, having
travelled straight through.</p>

<p>The Canadian Pacific Railway is probably
the most extensively advertised line in the
world. I cannot say it complied with modern
requirements as regards convenience and
comfort.</p>

<p>Every one knows the much-vaunted Pullman
Car system of America&mdash;men and women
in the same carriage, the only privacy being
offered by drawing the curtains across the
berths which are arranged in two long rows
on either side of the car.</p>

<p>If you have a section of two berths, which
is essential to comfort, you can stand upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the lower berth to dress and undress, and
put away your clothes where you can.</p>

<p>If you have only a single berth, you have
to dress and undress as best you can, sitting
in your berth.</p>

<p>On my first trip to Canada, I was only going
as far as Mattawa, one night in the train, so
contented myself with a single lower berth.</p>

<p>The upper berth was occupied by a very
stout lady, who in descending in the morning,
gave me an exhibition of understandings as
unexpected by me as it was unintentional on
her part.</p>

<p>The real advantage of a section, in taking
the long Trans-Continental journey, is that
when the berths are put up in the day-time,
one has a nice compartment to oneself; that is,
if the black porter does not condescend sometimes
to occupy one of the seats, and only to
move, on being politely requested to do so.</p>

<p>The sporting pamphlets of the Canadian
Pacific Railway make a sportsman's mouth
water. Here we have the paradise of the
fisherman&mdash;there the Mecca of the sportsman.</p>

<p>It was certainly then disappointing, to say
the least of it, to find in the Restaurant Car,
that though passing through the paradise of
the fisherman, two days out from Montreal,
we were eating stale mackerel, and on the return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
journey when the sporting season was in full
swing and duck and prairie hens were being
brought in abundance to the car for sale&mdash;they
were only purchased by the black porters
for re-sale at Montreal at a handsome profit.
None of them appeared at our table.</p>

<p>The food was indifferent and dear. Everything
was "à la carte," and to dine moderately
cost 1&frac12; to 2 dollars, while a tiny glass of whisky,
served in a specially constructed bottle of
infinitesimal proportions, was charged at an
exorbitant price.</p>

<p>Food in the car, without wine, beer or
spirits, may be put down at 5 to 6 dollars
a day, and I would recommend any one making
the trip to stow away a bottle of good whisky
in his suit-case, from which to fill his own
flask for meals.</p>

<p>Travelling for six days and five nights continuously,
one would have thought that some
simple bathing arrangements would have been
provided. A douche even would have been
welcome. The lavatory and smoking-room were
one and the same&mdash;five to six persons could find
sitting accommodation, and four basins had to
meet the washing requirements of the entire car.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be over critical, but I am
glad to say I have met many Canadians who
agree with me that the arrangements for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
comfort of the passengers on the Canadian
Pacific Railway are capable of improvement.</p>

<p>Very different, I was told, was the comfort to
be found on the American Trans-Continental
Line from Seattle via Chicago to New York.
The train is provided with a bathroom, library
and a barber's shop, while an American friend
who recommended me to return by the American
Express, assured me that the food left
nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>When competition arises between the two
Trans-Continental lines in Canada, the second
of which is now being constructed, some improvements
may be hoped for.</p>

<p>The scenery of the Rocky Mountains has so
often been described, that I will not inflict my
impressions at any length on my readers. It
is certainly fine, but no part of it can in my
opinion compare with that of the line from
Lucerne to Milan via the St. Gothard, and
what a difference in the engineering of the
line and the speed of the trains. Accidents
by derailing of ballast trains seemed fairly
common. We saw one on our way across,
and two engines which had toppled over the
embankment marked the site of at least one
other.</p>

<p>As regards the Rockies, it must be admitted
that the effect of their real height is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
away by the gradual rise in level as one crosses
the plains.</p>

<p>Calgary, where the mountains are first approached,
stands at 3,428 feet above sea-level.</p>

<p>All things come to an end, and the morning
of July 24th found us steaming into the city
of Vancouver, glad that the weary journey was
at last over.</p>

<p>The town of Vancouver is beautifully situated
on the Mainland overlooking the Straits
of Georgia.</p>

<p>I am glad, after my criticisms of the Canadian
Pacific Railway, to testify to the comfort and
moderate charges of the Canadian Pacific
Railway Hotel at Vancouver.</p>

<p>A charming bedroom with bathroom attached
cost only 5 dollars, all meals included.
Excellent beer, locally brewed, was cheap, and
a bottle of Californian Chianti, quite a drinkable
wine, cost only a dollar, so there was
nothing to complain of.</p>

<p>My waiter happened to be an Irishman, and
he took quite a personal interest in my comfort,
whispering into my ear in the most
confidential manner the dishes of the day that
he recommended as the best.</p>

<p>On a day's acquaintance, claiming me as a
countryman, he confided to me his story. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
father had been manager of a bank in Ireland,
and he was sent abroad to settle in Canada.</p>

<p>Starting on a farm, and, according to his
own story, doing well, a fire destroyed his
house and farm implements. Drifting through
various stages, he arrived at his present position,
with which he seemed quite content. He
was married, and lived outside the hotel.
Fishing was his passion, and every spare moment
was devoted to it.</p>

<p>He was really a most entertaining companion,
with a keen sense of humour, and he
made the meal-time pass very pleasantly, for
he never ceased chatting.</p>

<p>A run by steamer to Seattle to see some
friends, gave me a glimpse of Victoria and the
exquisite scenery of the trip from Vancouver
to Seattle.</p>

<p>At Vancouver I had the pleasure of making
the acquaintance of Mr. Bryan Williams, the
Provincial Game Warden of British Columbia,
with whom I had been already in correspondence,
and to whom I was indebted for much
valuable assistance and advice.</p>

<p>A true sportsman, his heart is in his job,
and if he only be given a free hand and adequate
funds, the preservation of game in British
Columbia will be in safe hands.</p>

<p>The licence, 100 dollars, is not a heavy one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
but I think it might with justice be graduated,
fixing one sum, say 50 dollars, for Vancouver
Island, where only wapiti, an occasional bear
and deer are found, and imposing the higher
licence for the Mainland, to include moose,
mountain sheep, goat, caribou and grizzly bear.</p>

<p>One would have thought that in the city
of Vancouver, the centre of a great angling
country, every requirement of the fisherman
would have been found. The contrary was
the case.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had brought my own fishing-tackle,
for in the best sporting shop in the town
I could not obtain a suitable spare fishing-line.</p>

<p>Rods, reels, lines, flies and baits were inferior
in workmanship as compared to what one
is accustomed at home.</p>

<p>I therefore strongly recommend any fisherman
to bring all his tackle from home. In
the case of rods, reels and lines, New York
may have better, as I shall show when I come
to discuss the question of tackle later on.</p>

<p>From the manager of the Bank of Montreal,
to whom I had a letter of introduction, I met
with great courtesy financially as well as
socially, and I became free of the excellent
Vancouver Club, so charmingly situated, and
only regretted that my short stay prevented
my availing myself more of its hospitality.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

VANCOUVER TO THE CAMPBELL RIVER</h2>


<p>The morning of July 29th found me on
board the <i>Queen City</i>, the small but most comfortable
steamer of the Canadian Pacific Railway
running north to the Campbell River and
beyond.</p>

<p>The Captain was a delightful companion,
patriotic to a degree, and regretting what he
considered the neglect shown by the Old
Country to the Dominion of Canada, when
American and Canadian interests were at
issue.</p>

<p>The steamer was well found and well managed,
while the Captain's skill in approaching
our various stopping-places, often dangerous
coves with no lights, at any time of the night
and in any weather, was to me a continual
source of admiration. I travelled with him
three times, and never wish for a more charming
host or a Captain that inspired more confidence
as a navigator.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Campbell River Pier at
the unearthly hour of 1 a.m. The proprietor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
however, was on the pier waiting with lanterns
to show us the way up to the Willows Hotel,
where I was to spend a happy month.</p>

<p>The Willows Hotel, beautifully situated on
the Valdez Straits within a few yards of the
sea, is all that a sportsman could desire. Clean,
well-furnished bedrooms, a bathroom and quite
a decent table, all for the moderate sum of
2 dollars a day.</p>

<p>The proprietor did not quite realize the fact
that the majority of the guests came for the
fishing, and not for the food.</p>

<p>The lady who directed the establishment
seemed to think the latter the more important.</p>

<p>The breakfast bell rang at 6 a.m., and breakfast
was served from 6 to 8 a.m. Lunch or
dinner from 12 to 2 p.m., and supper from 6
to 8 p.m.</p>

<p>Woe betide the guest who broke the rules
of the house as regards the hours, for he was
expected to lose his meal.</p>

<p>In those glorious autumn evenings when it
was light up to 10 o'clock, the manageress
forgot that a keen fisherman might stay out
till 9 or even 10, if the fish were taking.</p>

<p>Dinner he could not expect, but a cold
supper, if ordered beforehand, might have been
laid out in the dining-room. Nor could attendance
be looked for; servants were few and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
overworked, and it was but natural they should
like to go to bed at 10 o'clock, or be free to
wander in the woods or along the foreshore
with the special young man of the moment.</p>

<p>By making love to the manageress and the
Chinese cook, I generally succeeded in finding
something to eat if I was late, but I often
had to forage for myself in the kitchen, and
on one occasion came back to find a plate
of very indifferent sandwiches laid out for
supper.</p>

<p>Morning tea in one's bedroom was prohibited.
I should therefore advise any one
addicted to the habit of early morning tea,
to provide himself with a "Thermos" bottle,
and fill it overnight&mdash;besides which, if very
enthusiastic, a start might sometimes be made
at 4 a.m., when a cup of hot tea and a biscuit
make all the difference to one's feelings of
comfort.</p>

<p>The hotel was a strange mixture of civilization
and discomfort.</p>

<p>We had written menus of which I give a
specimen below, but I had to grease my own
boots and wash my own clothes, until I found
an Indian squaw in the adjoining village who
for an exorbitant charge relieved me of my
washing, though I greased my boots till the
end of my stay.</p>

<p>The drawback to the hotel was the logging
camp in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The bar of the hotel was about fifty yards
from the hotel itself, in a separate building,
and on Saturday night many of the loggers
came dropping in to waste the earnings of the
week. Drunkenness on these occasions was
far too common, and till the small hours of
the morning the sound of revelry from the bar
was not conducive to a good night's rest.</p>

<p>Some of the characters who frequented the
bar were weird in the extreme, and when fairly
"full"&mdash;as the local expression was&mdash;the hotel
was not inviolate to them. One who particularly
interested me might have been taken
out of one of Fenimore Cooper's novels. My
acquaintance with him was made on the hotel
verandah. With a friendly feeling born of
much whisky, he placed his arm on my shoulder,
and assured me that although if he had his
rights he would be a Lord, he did not disdain
the acquaintanceship of a commoner like myself;
in fact, that he had seldom seen a man
to whom he had taken such a fancy, or with
whom he would more willingly tramp the
woods, if I would only give him the pleasure
of my company in his trapper's hut some few
miles inland. His suggestion that our friendship
should be cemented by an adjournment to
the bar did not meet with the ready acceptance
he expected, which evidently disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
him, for he could not grasp the fact that
any one living could refuse a drink.</p>

<p>Poor "Lord B.," as he was called, was only
his own enemy. As I always addressed him
"My Lord," which he took quite seriously,
we became quite pals.</p>

<p>A trapper and prospector by profession, he
had a fair education, and when sober was a
shrewd man of the local world, which confined
itself to prospecting for minerals and cruising
timber claims.</p>

<p>Persistently drunk for two or three days at
a time, he would suddenly sober down, put a
pack on his back which few men could carry,
and disappear into the woods to his lonely log
cabin, only to return in a few days ready for
a fresh spree. At least, this was his life while
I stayed at the hotel, for in one month he
appeared three times.</p>

<p>No doubt during the winter, when occupied
with his traps, he could neither afford the time
nor the money for an hotel visit.</p>

<p>He was wizened in appearance and lightly
built, but as hard as nails. Dishevelled to
look at when on the spree, as soon as it was all
over he became a different character, appearing
in neat, clean clothes, and full of reminiscences
of backwoods life. He was always a
subject of interest to me, and, poor fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
like many others on the west coast, only his
own enemy.</p>

<p>Another frequenter of the bar had been on
the Variety stage in London, and his step-dancing
when fairly primed with whisky was
something to see and remember.</p>

<p>We were a pleasant party at the hotel.
Some came only for the fishing, some <i>en route</i>
for Alaska or elsewhere on the Mainland for
the coming shooting season, others returning
from sporting expeditions in far lands.</p>

<p>We had J. G. Millais, the well-known
naturalist and author of the most charming
book ever written on Newfoundland, bound for
Alaska in search of record moose and caribou.</p>

<p>Colonel Atherton, who, starting from India,
had recently crossed Central Asia and obtained
some splendid trophies, the photographs of
which made us all envious.</p>

<p>F. Grey Griswold from New York, of tarpon
fame, come to try his luck with the tyee salmon,
and good luck it was, which such a good
sportsman deserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Daggett, an enthusiastic angler from
Salt Lake City, who took plaster casts of his
fish, and was apparently an old habitué of the
hotel.</p>

<p>Powell and a young undergraduate friend
Stern, also bound for Alaska, just starting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the glorious life of sport, with little experience&mdash;that
was to come&mdash;but who with the tyee
salmon were as good as any of us, and whose
keenness spoke well for the future.</p>

<p>It was curious that in such a small community
three of us, the Colonel, Millais and I, had
fished in Iceland, and many interesting chats
we had about the sport in that fascinating
island.</p>

<p>As the sun went down, the boats began to
come in, and all interest was concentrated on
the beach, where the fish were brought to be
weighed on the very inaccurate steelyard set
up on a shaky tripod by the hotel proprietor.</p>

<p>Any one reading Sir Richard Musgrave's
article in the <i>Field</i>, would be led to believe
that the fishing was in the Campbell River
itself.</p>

<p>Whatever it may have been in his time,
the river is now practically useless from the
fisherman's point of view. This is due to the
logging camp in the vicinity, for the river for
about a mile from its mouth is practically
blocked with great rafts of enormous logs.
The logs are discharged into the river with a
roar and a crash, enough to frighten every
fish out of the water; the rafts when formed
are towed down to Vancouver.</p>

<p>The river no doubt was a fine one till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
logging business was established, and it is
possible that late in the autumn fish may run
up to spawn&mdash;but during the entire month of
August, I personally never saw a salmon of
any kind in the river itself.</p>

<p>Flowing out of the Campbell lake a few miles
away, its course is very rapid, and it falls into
the sea about one and a half miles north of
the hotel.</p>

<p>The falls, impassable for fish, can be visited
in a long day's walk from the hotel. The distance
is not great, but the impenetrable
character of the Vancouver forest makes the
walk a very fatiguing one. It is most regrettable
that no track has been cleared along the
banks, to enable the water to be fished and to
give access to the falls, which I am told are
very beautiful.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to reach them by the river,
but spent most of the day up to my waist in
water, hauling my boat through the rapids, and
then only got half-way and saw no fish.</p>

<p>Below the falls, there is a fine deep pool in
which Mr. Layard, who described his trip in
the <i>Field</i>, states he saw the great tyee salmon
"in droves." He does not say at what time
of the year he visited the falls or whether the
logging camp then existed. It must have been
late in the season, for he describes the swarms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of duck and wild geese, the seals that were a
perfect plague, the sea-lions that were seen
several times, and the bear, panther (cougar),
deer and willow grouse in the immediate
vicinity of the hotel.</p>

<p>I can only give my personal experiences
during the month of August.</p>

<p>Forgetting that the shooting season did not
begin till September 1st, I took with me
300 cartridges and never fired a shot, nor did
I see anything to shoot at. A few duck were
occasionally seen flying down the Straits between
Vancouver and Valdez Island, but the
seals, sea-lions and other game described by
Mr. Layard were conspicuous by their absence
in the month of August. No doubt later on,
in September and October, different conditions
may prevail, but August is the month <i>par
excellence</i> for the fisherman and he may leave
his gun behind.</p>

<p>The tide runs up the river for about 800
yards from the mouth, where there was some
water free from logs and rafts. Some good
sport with the cut-throat trout was to be had,
more especially at spring tides.</p>

<p>My best catch was fourteen weighing 16&frac12; lb.</p>

<p>The water was intensely clear; careful wading,
long casting and very fine tackle were necessary
to obtain any sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The cut-throat trout appeared to me to
resemble the sea trout in its habits, hanging
about the mouth of the river and running up
with the tide, many falling back on the turn
of the tide, but a certain number running up
and remaining in the upper reaches.</p>

<p>The largest I killed, 5 lb., was immediately
in front of the hotel, in the sea itself, one and a
half miles from the river, and he took a spoon
intended for a tyee salmon.</p>

<p>They were most sporting fish and were excellent
eating, differing in this respect from the
salmon. I only regretted I did not give more
time to them, but we all suffered from the same
disease, that desire to get the 70 lb. fish, or at
least something bigger than any yet brought
to the gaff.</p>

<p>I started with the best intentions, and talked
over with Mr. Williams at Vancouver the
possibility of inducing the tyee salmon to take
the fly, denouncing, as all true fishermen must
do, the monotony of trolling for big fish with
a colossal spoon and a six-ounce lead, which
takes away half the pleasure of the sport.</p>

<p>All the same I found myself sacrificing my
principles to the hope of the monster fish which
never came, but was always a possibility.</p>

<p>The Straits between Vancouver Island and
Valdez Island are about two miles broad, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
through them runs a tide against which it is
almost impossible to row a boat.</p>

<p>The favourite fishing-ground was about 300
yards north and south of the mouth of the
river, and tides had to be seriously considered
in getting on to the water.</p>

<p>Another good spot neglected by most of us,
except the Salt Lake City angler, was just
opposite the Indian Cemetery about a mile
from the hotel.</p>

<p>Here, in one morning, I killed three large
fish on my way back to the hotel from the
more favourite ground which I had fished all
the morning in vain.</p>

<p>South of the hotel and down to the Cape
Mudge Lighthouse, about four miles away, a
few tyee salmon were to be met with, but in
the water all along Valdez Island and near the
lighthouse, the cohoe salmon were in abundance,
and it was the favourite spot for the
Indian fishermen who were fishing for the
salmon cannery at Quatiaski.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

THE FISH AT THE CAMPBELL RIVER</h2>


<p>Different names have been given by different
sportsmen to the salmon found on the
Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>Sir R. Musgrave talks of spring salmon of
53 lb. and silver salmon of 16 and 8 lb.</p>

<p>I inquired carefully from the manager of the
Cannery Factory in Quatiaski Cove, and believe
the following to be the correct nomenclature.</p>

<p>The tyee or King salmon, running from 28 lb.
to 60 and upwards.</p>

<p>The spring salmon, which appeared to me to
be the young tyee, having the same relation
to the big tyee as the grilse has to the salmon,
from 15 to 20 lb.</p>

<p>The cohoe, which run from 7 to 12 lb.; and
lastly the blue back, generally termed cohoe,
averaging about 6 lb.</p>

<p>These latter most of us called cohoe, and were
the fish being caught on my arrival at the hotel.</p>

<p>The run of tyee had not regularly set in,
though a few odd ones were being caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Later on, when making a trip on the Cannery
steamer which collects fish daily from various
stations up and down the coast, the manager
of the factory, who was on board, pointed out
to me amongst the hundreds of fish we collected,
the difference between the blue back and the
real cohoe.</p>

<p>The former runs much earlier than the
latter, and is seldom over 6 lb. in weight; the
latter were, he stated, just beginning to run&mdash;then
the middle of August&mdash;and the largest on
board weighed 14 lb.</p>

<p>It was not, however, till my return from
Vancouver that I came across the volume on
<i>Salmon and Trout</i> of the American Sportsman's
Library, edited by Caspar Whitman, and
there found recorded all that is known about
the salmon and trout of the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>To begin with, the Pacific salmon does not
belong to the genus "Salmo," but to the genus
"Oncorhynchus," which, according to Messrs.
C. H. Townsend and H. W. Smith, the authors
of the most interesting chapters on the Pacific
salmon in the above-mentioned book, is peculiar
to the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the Pacific salmon seems
to be that they invariably die after spawning,
and never return to the sea.</p>

<p>In the case of the humpback, I saw this for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
myself later on in the season, when every stream
was literally a mass of moving fish all pushing
up to the head-waters, and there dying in vast
numbers.</p>

<p>The tyee salmon, "Oncorhynchus tschawytscha,"
has many names. It is known to the
Indians as "Chinook," "tyee" and "quinnat,"
to others as the Columbia salmon, the Sacramento
and King salmon.</p>

<p>It appears to range from Monterey Bay,
California, as far north as Alaska.</p>

<p>Messrs. Townsend and Smith state that in
the Yukon and Norton Sounds it attains a
weight of 110 lb., and in the Columbia 80 lb.</p>

<p>The largest I saw caught at Campbell River
weighed close on 70 lb. The largest fish brought
to the hotel by any of us was about 60 lb.</p>

<p>The blue back salmon, "Oncorhynchus
Nerka," is stated by the same authorities to run
up to 15 lb., and the average to be under 5 lb.</p>

<p>This would appear from its description to
correspond with the fish pointed out to me by
the Cannery manager as blue back&mdash;though
I cannot quite reconcile its other names: red
fish, red salmon, Fraser River salmon and
Sockeye&mdash;for the fishermen at Campbell River
spoke of the Sockeye as quite a different fish,
running at a different season of the year.</p>

<p>No doubt, however, the scientists are right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I only wish I had known of this valuable book
before instead of after my visit.</p>

<p>Another of the "Oncorhynchi" is the humpback,
"Oncorhynchus Gorbuscha," averaging
about 5 lb.</p>

<p>I only saw one caught on the rod at Campbell
River.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Oyster River, some
miles south, I saw them one evening in incredible
numbers, and though right in the
middle of immense shoals, I could not get them
to look at fly or spoon. A few yards up the
river they were said sometimes to take the fly.</p>

<p>The silver salmon, "Oncorhynchus Kisutch,"
known also as "Kisutch," "Skowitz," Hoopid
and lastly Cohoe, is stated to attain a weight
of 30 lb.&mdash;the average weight being about
8 lb. As stated before, the largest I saw was
14 lb. and the largest I caught 12 lb.</p>

<p>The above being the fish I met with at
Campbell River, I need not enter into the other
varieties. One interesting fact mentioned in
the book to which I am indebted for all the
above information is that the steel-head salmon
is one of the "Salmonidæ." "Salmo Gairdnerii"
differs from all other Pacific salmon,
in that it alone returns to the sea after spawning,
thus following the habits of the true
"Salmonidæ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The only trout I came across at Campbell
River or throughout my trip was that known
as the cut-throat, so called from the red slash
on the throat.</p>

<p>On turning to Mr. Wilson's article on "The
Trout of America," I was surprised to find that
there were thirteen varieties of this fish, but
so far as I could identify those I caught, they
must come under the heading of "Salmo
Clarkii," the cut-throat or Columbia River
trout.</p>

<p>After many inquiries and after having
visited the aquarium at New York, I was led
to believe that my fish was the "Salmo
Clarkii Pleuriticus," but as those I caught
had no lateral red band they must have been
the "Salmo Clarkii."</p>

<p>The largest I caught weighed 5 lb., and, as
I have mentioned before, it was caught in the
sea on a large spoon one and a half miles from
the river, when trolling for tyee.</p>

<p>The number of fish which frequent the
Campbell River waters is almost incredible.
When it is realized that between one and two
thousand salmon of the various kinds are
collected daily by the Cannery launch, and that
all these have been caught with rod and hand-line&mdash;the
great majority with hand-line&mdash;some
idea may be formed of their numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>No one fishing at the Campbell River should
miss the trip, which through the courtesy of
the manager at Quatiaski Cove is always
possible, of going with the Cannery steam-launch
on its daily round collecting fish at the
various stations, north and south.</p>

<p>Starting from Quatiaski early in the morning,
the run is down to Cape Mudge, where perhaps
thirty or forty boats, mostly Indian, have been
working their hand-lines the evening before.
From Cape Mudge up to the Seymour Narrows,
about seven miles, many calls are made.</p>

<p>Picturesque Indian camps are numerous all
along the shore, and at each of these a stop is
made. The canoes come crowding alongside,
and the fish are checked as they are thrown
into the deep well in the centre of the launch.</p>

<p>Each Indian has a book in which is entered
to his credit the number of his fish, and the
launch passes on to the next collecting station,
to which single canoes from all sides are gathering.
On the return the boats of the successful
hotel fishermen stop the launch and hand over
their catch, for the fish caught are the perquisites
of the men who row the boats.</p>

<p>On the day I made the trip we collected
about 1,500 salmon.</p>

<p>The business of the Cannery must be a profitable
one. So far as I could gather there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
but two prices: 50 cents for a tyee, no matter
what his weight was, and 10 cents for each
smaller fish.</p>

<p>Associated with the Cannery is a general
store kept by the Cannery owners, and payment
is partly made in goods, so the Cannery
has the double profit, first on the fish and then
on the goods bartered in exchange.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

SPORT AT CAMPBELL RIVER</h2>


<p>July 30th I looked forward to as a red-letter
day in my life, for was I not to have my first
chance for that 70 lb. fish, about which I had
dreamt for so many years?</p>

<p>The early morning (we were all up at 6 a.m.)
was spent in getting my tackle ship-shape, and,
most important of all, in engaging the services
of a good boatman&mdash;for on his strength and
willingness to "buck the tide," as they happily
term rowing against the strong tidal currents,
depends largely the chance of success.</p>

<p>The man I selected was a fine boatman.
Keen on getting fish&mdash;jealous of all others of
his craft, and with a capacity for bucking about
himself, and what he had done and could do,
which I have seldom seen equalled.</p>

<p>His command of strong and even highly
flavoured language was remarkable, but a little
of it went a long way. When I asked his name,
he replied, "Every one calls me Billy." No
one on the West coast seems to have a surname,
so "Billy" he was to me for all my fishing days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Billy was, I should say, about twenty-three
years of age, slightly built, but extraordinarily
strong with an oar. His temper was not of the
best, and when I lost a fish he always considered
that I was to blame, and resented the unfortunate
fact as if it were a personal insult to his
own powers as a boatman.</p>

<p>I don't believe he ever thought of the
Cannery or of the sum which under happier
auspices would have stood to his credit. His
pay was three dollars a day (12<i>s.</i>) plus the
value of the fish. His appetite corresponded
with his pay, which was large.</p>

<p>He was willing to row all day long with
suitable intervals for his meals&mdash;but any attempt
to keep him on the water at meal-time
was somewhat sulkily resented.</p>

<p>We fished together for some thirty days,
more or less harmoniously, and there was only
one great explosion which threatened to sever
our connection.</p>

<p>Through his gross stupidity my boat, which
was being towed behind the Cannery launch,
was upset, and I had the pleasure of seeing
all my fishing-tackle, fly-books, the companions
of years&mdash;all my pet flies, spoons,
spring balance&mdash;sunk in sixty feet of water&mdash;£20
worth of tackle gone in a moment.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had taken my rod and camera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
on board the launch, or they, too, would have
been lost.</p>

<p>It was <i>infra dig.</i> that he should express any
regret, and very unreasonable from his point
of view that I should show any annoyance,
which I did in what I considered very moderate
terms, considering the provocation.</p>

<p>On landing, he suggested that I did not seem
satisfied with him, which was quite true, and
that "Joe," a hated rival, was disengaged and
available.</p>

<p>I very nearly took him at his word and
"fired him out"&mdash;but we made it up somehow,
and he remained my boatman, though I never
quite forgave the loss of so much valuable
tackle.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had only a few more fishing
days left and had some spare tackle to replace
what was gone.</p>

<p>Our opening day was simply glorious, a
bright sun and a crispness in the air which made
one feel that it was good to be alive.</p>

<p>The scenery was exquisite. The sea calm
as a mill-pond, only broken by the oily swirls of
the rushing tide, and then there was the possibility
of that long-hoped-for big fish, who did
not come that day, though every pull from a
cohoe might have been him.</p>

<p>Billy was positively polite, as it was his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
day. Why many of these West coast men
should imagine that politeness means servility,
while roughness and rudeness only show
equality and independence of character, I
never could understand.</p>

<p>It was not long before I was in a fish, but as
he was only a 5&frac12; lb. cohoe, he was hauled in
with scant ceremony and was soon in the
net.</p>

<p>As I shall have something to say about
tackle later on, I would only now mention
that I was fishing with a fourteen-foot Deeside
spinning rod, made by Blacklaw of Kincardine.</p>

<p>I had a large Nottingham reel with 200
yards of tarpon line, purchased in England,
not, alas! in New York; a heavy gut trace
with large brass swivels which would have
frightened any but a Vancouver salmon; a
4 oz. lead, I afterwards came to a 6 oz., and
one of Farlow's spoons specially made for the
tastes of Vancouver salmon.</p>

<p>My bag that day, fishing morning and
evening, was only six cohoe, weighing 3O&frac12; lb.
and one cod about 5 lb. I never had a pull
from a tyee.</p>

<p>The row home that evening compensated for
everything. The sun was setting behind the
snow-covered peaks of the Vancouver Mountains,
bare and cold below the snow-line, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
gradually clothed with foliage down the slopes
till the dense pine forest of the plain between
the mountains and the sea was reached, from
which the evening mists were beginning to rise.
In the foreground, the sea, like molten glass,
reflected the exquisite colouring of the northern
sunset, its surface broken by the eddies of the
making tide, or the occasional splash of a
leaping salmon. Across the Straits on the
Mainland, the tops of the great mountains
clothed with eternal snow were lit up a rose-pink
by the rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>I have seldom seen a more beautiful scene,
or one which gave such a deep sense of peace.
There was a grandeur and immensity about it
which satisfied one's very soul, it amply justified
the realization of the call of the wild which
had brought me so many thousand miles to
those distant shores.</p>

<p>The morning of the 31st found me late in
starting, as I had to interview Cecil Smith, who
was to be my guide, companion and friend on
my hunting trip in September.</p>

<p>On that morning, I got only two cohoes of
5&frac12; and 4&frac12; lb., one spring salmon of 9 lb., and
as there was evidently no take on, I went up
the river for a short time. I saw no salmon,
but landed three cut-throat trout weighing
3&frac12; lb., one a good fish of 2 lb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>On the way home to luncheon I killed a
20 lb. fish&mdash;a small tyee, and going out for
half-an-hour in the evening after dinner lost a
heavy fish.</p>

<p>Bad luck as regards the big fish still pursued
me. It was true the big run of tyee had not
yet begun, but a few were being taken from day
to day.</p>

<p>On the morning of August 1st I hooked a
heavy fish, but in his second big race, the line
slipped over the drum of the Nottingham reel
and the inevitable break came.</p>

<p>My catch that day was only three cohoes
and three cut-throat trout.</p>

<p>A very high north wind blowing against the
tide raised a heavy swell, and fishing was
impossible in the afternoon.</p>

<p>August 2nd, I fished all the morning without
getting a pull, so decided to try to go up the
river to the falls, which attempt, as previously
described, was not a success.</p>

<p>Returning to the sea in the afternoon I found
Griswold with three fine fish, of 59, 45 and
40 lb. I landed a small tyee of 30&frac12; lb. and
four cohoe weighing 20 lb.</p>

<p>On August 3rd, I got my first good fish of
53 lb. and another of 42 lb. The tide was
running strong and the 53 lb. fish took out
about 120 yards of line, but eventually I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
him in hand, when he made two wild runs&mdash;threw
himself clean out of the water each time
and then went to the bottom like a stone and
sulked.</p>

<p>It took me just under an hour to kill that
fish, and I found that he was foul hooked on the
side of the head.</p>

<p>The 42 lb. fish was a lively one and tired
himself out by repeated runs&mdash;he never got to
the bottom and in about fifteen minutes he
came to the gaff.</p>

<p>In addition to the two tyee, I had seven
cohoe weighing 46&frac12; lb., so luck was beginning
to turn.</p>

<p>August 4th was a great day. Four tyee,
45, 44&frac12;, 42&frac12; and 35 lb.; one cohoe, 6 lb.;
one cut-throat trout, 5 lb., a picture of a fish;
one sea trout, 2 lb., and one cod, 5 lb.; all
before two o'clock.</p>

<p>There was a big take in the evening, and I
missed it by getting out too late.</p>

<p>Griswold had five tyee, the largest 47 lb.; I
came in for the tail end of the take and only
picked up eight cohoe, weighing 43&frac12; lb., and
one spring salmon, 13 lb. Total weight for
the day: 240&frac12; lb.</p>

<p>August 5th. I had two tyee, 45 and 37 lb.,
and sixteen cohoe averaging about 6 lb., and
so on day after day, with varying luck and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
always hoping for that 70 lb. fish which never
came.</p>

<p>On August 10th, I got my second biggest
fish. The spring tides were racing up and down
the Straits and it was impossible to hold a boat,
much less row it against the tide.</p>

<p>By this time from a study of the bottom, at
low water, I had a fair idea of how the fish ran
up and down with the tide. I accordingly
anchored my boat off a point I knew the fish
were bound to pass. The anchor was fixed
on to a log of wood to which the boat was
moored by a running knot. It was Billy's
duty to cast off the moment I was in a fish.</p>

<p>The greatest race of the tide was at about half
flood, and the current was so strong that the
heavy spoon and 6 oz. lead were swept away
like a cork. Letting out about thirty yards of
line and giving Billy the rod to hold, I began
casting with the fly, using a fourteen-foot
Castleconnell rod, fine tackle and a two-inch
silver doctor. I soon had a sea trout, 2&frac12; lb.,
and two cohoe, besides many rises, and grand
sport these fish gave in the racing tide on a light
rod.</p>

<p>I had just killed my last fish when the scream
of the reel on the rod which Billy was holding
told me we were in a big fish. Taking the rod
from Billy, I told him to cast off. The fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was racing up with the tide some 150 yards
away, but the rope was fouled, or Billy bungled,
and the result was a smash.</p>

<p>Hardly had I got out another spoon when I
was in another fish. I was evidently lying in
their track. This time we got away, and how
that fish raced! Before I knew where I was we
were up about a mile, being literally towed by
him on the flowing tide before I could get him
in hand. I eventually killed him, almost
opposite the hotel, one and a half miles from
where I had hooked him: weight, 59 lb.</p>

<p>In the evening I got two tyee of 47 and
46 lb. The big fish's measurements were:
length, 47&frac12; inches; greatest girth, 31&frac12; inches,
and girth round the anal fin, 22 inches.</p>

<p>The well-known formula for estimating the
weight of a fish from measurement is as
follows&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="center">girth^2 × length</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="center">weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">800</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Applying this formula, the weight worked
out just 59 lb., which the scales corroborated.
The weighing machine, an old rusty steelyard,
set up on the beach in front of the hotel, left a
good deal to be desired; but I had a spring
balance weighing up to 60 lb., which I tested
at the local store and found to be quite accurate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<p>On August 24th heavy clouds were piling up,
and a break in the glorious weather we had
enjoyed from the beginning of August seemed
imminent.</p>

<p>On August 26th, my last day at the hotel, I
started to fish in a heavy gale from the south-east,
the worst wind one could have in these
waters.</p>

<p>Though leaving that night and having all my
packing to do, I determined to have one last
try for the big fish which had so far evaded me.</p>

<p>There was a heavy sea on and it was almost
impossible to hold the boat, but Billy was on
his mettle for the last day's fishing and really
did wonders.</p>

<p>On the way down to the mouth of the river,
I got a 10 lb. cohoe, and on arriving at the best
ground I put on a big brass spoon, which Mr.
Daggett had kindly lent me, about twice as long
as the Farlow spoon. I was letting out the
spoon when I got a tremendous pull and a very
short run, which apparently took the fish to
the bottom or into some kelp. There he
remained and simply sulked without taking out
a yard of line.</p>

<p>The rod was bent double and I put on all the
strain possible, but it was a full three-quarters
of an hour before I could see my lead coming up
to the surface, and my arms and back were
aching. How the rod did not break I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
understand, for the fish came up gradually
from straight under the boat; but at last I had
the gaff in the biggest but least sporting fish
I had killed during the month. He weighed
59&frac12; lb. at the hotel, having lost a good deal of
blood, and must have been over 60 lb. when he
came out of the water. The brass spoon was
either bitten or broken in half.</p>

[<i>To face page 50.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Having killed forty-one tyee, fished steadily
for a month, and seen most of the fish that were
caught, I do not think many fish over 60 lb. are
killed. One fish caught by a hand-line and
small spoon by a young settler named Pidcock,
I weighed, and he must have been close on
70 lb. My spring balance went down with a
rush to its limit of 60 lb., and I heard afterwards
that when weighed at the Cannery it
scaled 68 lb., so when fresh must have been
close on 70 lb. This was the biggest fish I saw
on the coast.</p>

<p>Farther north there are other fishing grounds
well worth a visit, where the fish are said to run
up to 100 lb.&mdash;such are the Kitimaat River
and McCallister's Bay at the entrance to
Gardner Canal, about four hundred miles north
of Campbell River.</p>

<p>A steamer runs direct to Kitimaat and
Hartley Bay once a month. Accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
can be had at Kitimaat, but a camp is necessary
at McCallister's Bay. Fish run as early as
May. Campbell River is getting too well
known, and there are too many boats on the
water.</p>

<p>The following amusing description of an
evening's fishing is from the clever pen of
J. G. Millais, and was published in <i>Country
Life</i>. I venture to reproduce it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Amidst gorgeous sunset hues we went to
fish the usual beat opposite the Indian village
on August 11th. The sun had already set,
when of a sudden a suppressed excitement ran
through the boats. A fresh run of tyee were
in and had begun to take. Three or four
Indians were 'fast' at once, and yells for help
came down the line. In a moment, while close
to the beacon stake at the mouth of the river,
Mr. Powell, Sir John Rogers and I were 'into'
fish at the same moment.</p>

<p>"Then the circus began. 'Look out there;
don't you see I'm fast?' 'Confound you;
get up your line, or I'll be over you.' 'Gangway,
gangway,' 'Where the devil are you
coming to!' 'Mind your oars,' 'He's off to
the tide. Hurry' (Mac or Bill, as the case
might be); 'row like blazes,' were a few of the
cries that broke from excited anglers, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>even phlegmatic Indians grinned or yelled
'tyee, tyee' in sympathetic encouragement.
We all cleared each other somehow. I do not
quite know how. Sir John was whisked
straight out to sea, and was a quarter of a mile
off in no time. Mr. Powell broke, while my
fish, to my horror, went straight for the beacon.
I lugged at him to steer clear, and he took the
hint so forcibly that he burnt my finger on the
line with the rush he made for the deep water.
It was like poor Dan Leno's hunting song,
'Away, away and away. I don't know where
we're going to, but away and away and away.'
We could hear men laughing and joking in the
darkness behind, and then in a moment we
were out of it all in the silence of the boiling
tide. Mac was a good boatman, and the way
he followed that tyee in the eight-knot current
did him credit. This was the strongest fish I
have ever hooked. He seemed to do with us
just what he chose, and we, like sheep, had to
follow. If he had carried out his first laudable
intention of a visit to Queen Charlotte Islands
he might have defeated us, but seemingly he
altered his plan and made a fierce hundred
yards' run for the curl of the current at the
mouth of the Campbell River. Here there
were nasty lumps of floating kelp, and the two
anglers fishing there received our return landwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>with shouts of warning. In the gloom
I could see by their attitudes that they were
intensely interested in our welfare, for the next
best thing to playing a fish yourself is to watch
another at the game. Then began a series of
'magnificent cruises.' It is part of the interest
in salmon-fishing that the fish you have 'on'
is infinitely larger than anything previously
hooked. Generally it is a pleasant delusion;
but sometimes it is true, and then the conflicting
emotions of the play and the thrill of
subsequent capture are something to live for.</p>

<p>"My fish was, I knew, the biggest I had ever
hooked, so one had to follow the same old ways
of playing him, coupled with such extra force
as that stout tackle warranted. After every
great circuit of the boat I resorted to all sorts
of devices for tiring my antagonist, but he
refused to give in or to allow me to shorten
the line. But my fish was as gallant a fighter
as ever was hatched, and the better the fighter
the quicker he kills himself. Half-an-hour has
elapsed and I see the lead six feet up the line
for the first time. Soon we shall see back and
tail. Yes, there they are, and what a monster.
He must be 60 lb. at least. At last he shows
side, and that is the beginning of the end.
Mac, an indifferent gaffer under the most
favourable circumstances, now surpasses himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the fields of incompetence. He makes
one or two feeble shots, and then, getting the
gaff well home, attempts to lift the fish as I
throw my weight on to the reverse side of the
light boat to prevent an upset. He heaves
with both hands, and a great head appears,
when crack goes the steel, and Mac sits down
heavily in the boat, looking supremely foolish.
I was not distressed, however, as that brief
view of the fish's head had shown me the hook
well placed; moreover, I knew that somewhere
under the thwarts we possessed a goodly club.
Mac, after a few moments' search, produced
the truncheon, and, at the first attempt,
stunned the salmon with a well-directed blow,
and lifting it with his hand drew it into the
boat. Ha! this is a fish indeed; one of the
best of the season, we flatter ourselves, and
60 lb. for certain. But no; those cruel scales
blast our hopes by 3 lb. Still, a fifty-seven-pounder
is something to be proud of, and we
rowed home that night at peace with the
world. This, then, is Campbell River fishing
for the great tyee salmon. If you wish to
collect records you can do so by sitting all day
in your boat for a month and using a tarpon-rod,
which kills the biggest fish in two minutes,
and a Vom Hofe reel, which carries a drag that

<p>If there are many Indians out the rod has
not much chance, for their canoes cross and
recross in every direction, and as they fish with
a short hand-line, a long line let out from the
rod is apt to get fouled.</p>

<p>Fortunately, their favourite ground is by
Cape Mudge Lighthouse, where the cohoe
abound. I only tried this water once, and
was so jostled by Indian canoes that I determined
to stick to the tyee and the mouth of the
Campbell River.</p>

<p>The large majority of the salmon were really
sporting fish. The cohoe had no chance with
the strong tackle necessary for the tyee, but
still were wonderfully lively, and when caught
with light tackle on the fly, gave great sport.</p>

<p>In one respect they were all a hopeless failure&mdash;they
were quite unfit to eat. Why it should
be so I cannot say. Perfect to look at, as
good as any Atlantic fish, the flesh was like
cotton wool, dry and devoid of all flavour. On
the other hand, the cut-throat trout were
excellent eating.</p>

<p>During the entire month of August we had
little or no rain. The climate was absolutely
ideal and the eye never tired of the exquisite
scenery, varying in colouring and effect every
day.</p>

<p>The row of one and a half miles from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hotel to the best fishing ground, if the tide was
not favourable, was a drawback, and personally
I should prefer to pitch a camp on one
of the many excellent sites at the mouth of the
Campbell River, so one would be independent
of the hotel hours and meals. When the tide
is not favourable, a good plan is to leave the
boat at the mouth of the river and walk home
along the shore to the hotel for meals.</p>

<p>The fish generally took best at the turn of the
tide, and about half water. Many enthusiasts
were out at 3 and 4 a.m. and in some cases
struck a good rise, but these early mornings
without a cup of tea, I fear, did not often
appeal to me.</p>

<p>So the last day had come and the fishing was
to be a memory of the past. Our pleasant
party was broken up&mdash;Millais and his young
undergraduate friends, Powell and Stern, had
gone north to Wrangel to start on their hunting
trip in Alaska; Griswold back to New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
planning the construction of a special boat and
the adding of the great tuna to his many
trophies of big sea fish. Daggett alone remained,
seated daily in the comfortable armchair
he had rigged up in his boat, still intent
on that 70 lb. fish we had all hoped for, but
failed to secure.</p>

<p>The pleasant days of friendly intercourse had
come to an end. No more the quiet row home
in the gloaming after a successful or moderately
successful day. No more the nightly gathering
on the beach and the weighing of the great
fish. The weather itself looked despondent,
and was making up its mind to break. The
certainty of the past was over, the uncertainty
of the future before me, and it was with a sad
heart I bade farewell to the Willows Hotel,
and to the fishing days that were now no more.</p>

<p>The depressing hour of 1 a.m. found me sitting
on the end of the pier waiting for the
arrival of the <i>Queen City</i>, which was only an
hour late, and once more I was bound for the
unknown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

FISHING-TACKLE</h2>


<p>As regards tackle, one rule only must be
followed: everything must be of the best, and
the best is to be obtained either in England or
New York.</p>

<p>The choice of a rod is a difficult matter, and
depends altogether on the individual idea of
what constitutes sport.</p>

<p>If by sport is meant the taking of the
greatest number of fish in the shortest possible
time, in fact the making of a record&mdash;no rod
is necessary. Follow the Indian method of
fishing with a strong hand-line and no trace,
the spoon being fastened on to the line direct.
The moment the fish is on, if a small one, he is
hauled hand over hand up to the canoe and
jerked in&mdash;if a tyee, he is played by hand. I
have never seen one allowed to make a race,
and when fairly done he is hauled alongside the
canoe, the line held short with the left hand,
while a sharp blow on the head is administered
with a wooden club, and he is then done for
and lifted into the boat&mdash;no gaff being used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>It is astonishing how quick the Indians are
in killing even a large tyee by this method.
The hand playing apparently takes all the life
out of the fish, and the strong tackle does the
rest.</p>

<p>I have seen many white men follow this
system&mdash;but they were all fishing for business
and the Cannery. Only one white man from
the hotel fished in this way, and I don't
think any of us envied him his so-called
sport.</p>

<p>The take comes on quite unexpectedly&mdash;boats
will be rowing backwards and forwards
without a pull. Suddenly the take comes on
and nearly every boat may be in a fish. He,
therefore, who can kill his fish quickest will
make the biggest bag, if record breaking be his
object.</p>

<p>I have seen one Indian canoe bring in over
one hundred fish in a day's fishing&mdash;but is this
sport? I think all true fishermen will say it is
not.</p>

<p>After the hand-line comes the rod, and again,
if the object be to catch as many fish as possible
while the take is on, a small tarpon rod with
a Vom Hofe multiplying reel and an 18-thread
tarpon line, practically unbreakable, may be
used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>One American tarpon fisher, Mr. Griswold, a
true sportsman too, followed this method and
naturally defended it. I do not in any way
criticize his methods, I only felt they did not
appeal to me. It is true I have seen him kill
three fish while I was killing one, but I did not
feel at all envious.</p>

<p>Generous to a degree, he more than once
offered to fit me out and instruct me in the art
of "pumping" fish, but though much tempted,
I did not fall. Had I succumbed, I much fear
I should have become an ardent advocate of
tarpon methods applied to tyee salmon.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to fish for tyee with a
highly finished 18-foot split cane, or other make
of rod, seemed to me out of place. There were
some who did it and gloried in the fact that
they had caught a great tyee on an ordinary
home salmon rod.</p>

<p>It seemed to me a waste of good material,
for the rod was likely to be broken or permanently
strained in the process of lifting a great
fish from the depths of the sea&mdash;for after one
or two rushes taking out 100 to 150 yards of
line, the tyee will often go straight down to the
bottom, stand on his head and sulk, and then
you want that power to bring him up which only
a very stiff rod possesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>One of our number who had killed many a
salmon at home, fished with an ordinary
18-foot rod. The fish seemed to do what it
liked with him, and it generally ended in the
rod being lowered till the tip touched the
water, and the boat disappearing in tow of the
fish, up or down the Straits with the racing
tide.</p>

<p>In fact the fish was being played on the line
from the reel without the power of a hand-line.
To give him the butt would have inevitably
resulted in breaking the rod. Yet this good
sportsman sometimes got his fish and came
back triumphant, having had him on for a
couple of hours.</p>

<p>The local rods, whether those to be obtained
in Vancouver or at the store on the pier at
Campbell River, seemed to me most inferior
in quality and workmanship, and the same
applies to all other tackle, except possibly the
leads, which are too heavy to carry about and
which can be purchased locally.</p>

<p>As stated before, I used a three-piece Deeside
spinning rod, twelve feet long, built by Blacklaw
of Kincardine&mdash;but I must confess that
twice my tip was broken by the strain of the
weight of a big fish which had to be brought
up to the gaff from the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Many a time was this little rod bent double,
till I wondered how it ever bore the strain.
On it I had killed all my tyee and most of my
cohoe, but it suffered in the process, and the
middle and top joints had to be replaced on
my return home. If I were going again, I
should feel inclined to take a 10-foot rod built
on the same lines and of the very best material
and workmanship. Such a rod would give
more power and stiffness than the 12-foot
rod.</p>

<p>Besides the 12-foot rod, I had a 14-foot
three-piece Castleconnell rod, an old friend.
This I used for fishing for cohoe with the fly,
and grand sport they gave in the racing tide
on a rod which played its fish right down
to the reel. An ordinary 12-foot trout rod
for the cut-throat trout completed my rod
equipment.</p>

<p><i>Reels and Lines.</i>&mdash;I started with a large
Nottingham reel, but soon gave it up. It had
the advantage, of course, of not rusting, but
the workmanship could not stand the rush of a
heavy fish. I lost big fish by the line slipping
over the drum and jamming, though I had
fixed up the usual guard improvised out of
the brass wire handle of a tin can purchased
locally. I then came to my largest bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
salmon reel, after which I had no more trouble&mdash;though
the salt water caused rusting of the
screws.</p>

<p>The reel should take 200 yards of tarpon line
and be of the very best and strongest make.
The Vom Hofe multiplying reels are perfect
specimens of workmanship, and the attached
leather drag worked by pressure with the
thumb is an excellent device. In fact, for the
big fish, from tyee to tarpon, I think the
American tackle makers beat us as regards
reels and lines.</p>

<p>I purchased two tarpon lines in London; who
the maker was I cannot say. One did good
service, the other seemed of inferior quality,
for it broke without any special reason.</p>

<p>I should recommend 200 yards of 18 or 21
Vom Hofe tarpon line, which now can be purchased
in England at Messrs. Farlow &amp; Son's,
or in New York.</p>

<p>One great advantage of this line is that it
need neither be washed in fresh water after
use in the sea nor dried. It can remain on the
reel wet without rotting.</p>

<p><i>Gaff.</i>&mdash;Farlow makes a specially strong gaff
lashed into a long ash or hazel handle. I found
this quite satisfactory. On the other hand,
the American fishermen use quite a short gaff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but fishing with a six or seven foot tarpon
rod they can bring the fish much closer up to
the side of the boat.</p>

<p>A good strong landing net capable of taking
a fish up of eight or ten pounds is most useful,
and saves gaffing the smaller salmon.</p>

<p><i>Flies.</i>&mdash;I started with the idea that the
ordinary trout fly on No. 11 or 13 hook should
be as good in Vancouver as it was in Scotland.
I had very soon to acknowledge my mistake&mdash;the
trout preferred a small salmon fly on No. 8
hook; silver grey, silver doctor, Wilkinson and
Jock Scott, I found the best patterns.</p>

<p>The cohoe took a 2-inch silver doctor and
rose steadily to the fly.</p>

<p><i>Spoons and Minnows.</i>&mdash;Spoons can be obtained
locally, either in Vancouver or in the
Campbell River Store, but I should recommend
their being purchased in England. The spoon
specially made by Farlow is three inches long,
silver on both sides, with a hook attached
to the end of the spoon by a strong wire
loop.</p>

<p>Local tastes varied, and in the local store
there were many varieties of spoons. One
year dull lead spoons were supposed to be
most killing&mdash;another year it would be brass.
Each fisherman had his special fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Griswold had a silver spoon invented by
a friend of his, or himself, for which a patent
was about to be applied. He naturally, therefore,
did not wish to give away the secret. It
certainly was a most killing bait, and Mr.
Griswold, between his special spoon and his
tarpon methods, killed more fish than any of
us for the time he remained at the Campbell
River.</p>

<p>He most generously lent me one of his pet
spoons on a day he was hauling in fish and I was
getting nothing. I was promptly in a big fish
which broke me, owing to the line jamming
round the Nottingham reel, and away went the
patent spoon. I did not feel justified in examining
the spoon too closely or taking a drawing
of it. It seemed longer than the Farlow spoon.
The hook was suspended by a chain and
the bait seemed to wobble rather than spin.
The material was metal with bright silver
plating.</p>

<p>An ordinary large-sized silver Devon Minnow
spun from the boat, or at Cape Mudge from
the shore, will take cohoe, and good sport can
be obtained in this way.</p>

<p>A Tacomah spoon is deadly for cut-throat
trout, but I preferred the fly.</p>

<p><i>Traces.</i>&mdash;I took out some specially strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
gut spinning traces made by Farlow, but I do
not think any traces are necessary. The line
is quite as invisible as the trace, and a few feet
can be made into a trace by fixing two or three
swivels&mdash;bronze, if possible, instead of bright
brass&mdash;about two feet apart.</p>

<p>For fly fishing, good stout loch casting lines
which will land a five or seven pound fish are
sufficient. Very fine trout casts are unnecessary,
except for trout in the river.</p>

<p><i>Leads.</i>&mdash;These can be purchased locally, and
one is saved the trouble of adding to the weight
of baggage.</p>

<p>The method of fastening the lead on to the
line all depends on whether it is decided to lose
the lead when the fish is hooked or to fix it
permanently on the line. A six-ounce lead
when the fish is being played takes away considerably
from the pleasure, owing to the dead
weight on the rod. On the other hand, if it
be decided to lose the lead each time a fish is
hooked, a couple of hundred leads may be
required.</p>

<p>In the former case, two methods can be
adopted: loop up the line about twenty feet
from the spoon with a piece of thread, on which
is hung the lead; when the strike comes the
thread is broken and the lead slips off&mdash;or, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
described by Mr. Whitney: Tie two swivels on
the line, nine inches apart; a small ring is
soldered to one end of the lead, join the two
swivels by a piece of weak cotton, thread
the cotton through the ring of the lead and
shorten it to four inches, which loops up the
line, and when the strike comes the lead is
released.</p>

<p>In the latter case, which I adopted, I found
the simplest way was to cut the line about ten
feet from the spoon and fasten the lead by two
split rings and two swivels. Starting with a
four-ounce lead I soon came to a six ounce,
which I believe to be the most suitable,
certainly in spring tides.</p>

<p><i>Odds and Ends.</i>&mdash;One must carry out all one's
own repairs, therefore an ample supply of
repairing material and spare tackle must be
taken.</p>

<p>Strong silk for splicing breakages, cobbler's
wax, seccotine or liquid glue, rod varnish,
spare hooks, split rings, bronze single and
double swivels, fine copper wire, snake rod
rings, and screws for reels.</p>

<p>A small portable case of tools, such as the
"Bonsa," is invaluable, and with this and a
sharp clasp knife most current repairs can be
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Two good spring balances are advisable, one
weighing up to seventy or eighty pounds, and
one up to fifteen pounds. Both should be
tested, which avoids any dispute afterwards as
to their accuracy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

TO ALERT BAY</h2>


<p>The morning of the 27th fulfilled the promise
of the previous day. The weather had at
last broken, and it was in a dense wetting mist
that we crept north, bound for Alert Bay.
We had no delay at the Seymour Narrows,
which can only be navigated at a certain state
of the tide. The whole force of the Pacific
runs through these narrows&mdash;not more than
half-a-mile broad&mdash;and the eddies and whirlpools
that are formed are terrifying. There
is one great rock in the middle of the passage&mdash;a
special source of danger.</p>

<p>I had visited these narrows in a steam
launch from the hotel, and had there seen the
water at its worst&mdash;a wonderful sight; but the
tide was now suitable, and as the <i>Queen City</i>
passed through there was only a strong current.</p>

<p>The best guides and hunters are always
snapped up early in the season, and before I
left England, Mr. Bryan Williams had secured
for me the services of Cecil Smith&mdash;better
known in the local sporting world as "Cougar"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Smith, from the number of cougars he had shot.
As he lived at Quatiaski Cove, immediately
opposite the Willows Hotel, I had frequently
met him and discussed our plans together.</p>

<p>We had arranged to go from Alert Bay up
the Nimquish River to the Nimquish Lake,
from which we were to strike in north-west
to some valleys in the interior where wapiti
were reported as fairly plentiful. Cecil Smith
did not know the ground personally, but his
brother Eustace, who had been in that part
of the country several times, was to meet us
at Alert Bay and act as head guide. Unfortunately
for us, at the last moment he was
unable to come, and we had to find our way
as best we could in an unknown and unmapped
country. I had to find a man to replace
Eustace Smith, and was fortunate in picking
up Joe Thomson at Campbell River, and two
better men than Smith and Thomson I could
not have had.</p>

<p>Smith was to act as head hunter and guide
and Thomson more particularly look after
the cooking and camp generally. Thomson
came on board with me and we picked up
Smith at Quitiaski Cove at about 4 a.m.</p>

<p>Two other members of the party were even
of more interest to me than the men. They
were "Dick" and "Nigger," the latter generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
known as "Satan." "Dick," who belonged
to Smith, was a most adorable dog and
celebrated throughout Vancouver for treeing
cougars; indeed, as Smith himself acknowledged,
he owed his reputation as a cougar
hunter to Dick, who did everything except
the actual shooting. It was difficult to say
what Dick's breed was. He looked like a
cross between a spaniel and a retriever. He
was one of the most fascinating dog characters
I have ever met. He adored his master, who
returned his worship, but ingratiated himself
with every one; soon discovering that I had
a warm corner in my heart for all dogs, we at
once became fast friends.</p>

<p>"Nigger," the property of Thomson, was
a powerful, black, evil-looking bull terrier,
but like many of his kind his character belied
his looks, for he really was a soft-hearted,
affectionate beast with a special ability for
making himself comfortable under any circumstances.
Thomson asserted that if there was
no food, "Nigger" subsisted on berries, and
he was an adept at catching fish for himself
in the river. He had had some trouble with
the authorities at Comox in a matter of sheep,
and so a temporary absence from his native
town was desirable, and he became, to his
great joy, one of our party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>At 2 p.m. on the 27th we arrived at Alert
Bay, which is situated on an island opposite
where the Nimquish River discharges itself
into the sea. Alert Bay is an important
settlement of the Siwash Indians, and the
village possesses one of the most remarkable
collections of Totem Poles on the coast.</p>

<p>The question was, where to put up&mdash;hotels
there were none. Mr. Chambers, the local
merchant, had in the most generous manner
built an annexe to his charming house, containing
several bedrooms, but they were all
occupied. Fortunately, I had been introduced
to Mr. Halliday, the Alert Bay Indian
Agent, at Campbell River, and he most kindly
offered me a shakedown on a sofa in his
drawing-room, which I gratefully accepted.
I found Mr. Halliday was devoted to music,
but seldom could find an accompanist&mdash;while
to accompany was a pleasure to me, and we
passed the evening going through many songs
I had not heard for years, which recalled the
Old Country and days long gone by.</p>

<p>Eustace Smith met us here and gave a rough
sketch map to his brother Cecil, and indeed
pointed out to us the peak on Vancouver
Island under which we were to camp, and which
only looked about fifteen miles off as the crow
flies, and yet what difficulty we had afterwards
to find our way through the impenetrable
forest!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The morning of the 28th was spent in sorting
out the kit we could take with us, which,
as packing was our only means of transport,
had to be cut down to nothing. Mine consisted
of two flannel shirts, one change of
underclothing, two pairs of socks, one sweater,
one spare pair of boots, a few handkerchiefs,
sponge, soap and towel. One Hudson Bay
blanket, for it was not yet cold in the woods,
and one waterproof ground sheet in which the
pack was made up, completed my outfit. The
men had a single fly to sleep under. My tent,
which Mr. Williams had kindly ordered for me
in Vancouver, was of the lean-to pattern, made
with a flap which let down in front in bad
weather, completely closing the tent. Being
made of so-called silk, it weighed only five
pounds. It measured 7 feet × 6 feet, was
about 7 feet high in front and sloped back to
about 2 feet high behind. It was most comfortable
so long as one slept on the ground,
but was not high enough behind to take even
a small camp bedstead. It was quite waterproof,
but should a spark from the fire fall on
it, a hole was burnt rapidly. I understand
that the following renders the silk almost fire-proof&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Dissolve half-a-pound of powdered alum in
a bucket of soft boiling water. In another
bucket half-a-pound sugar of lead; when dissolved
and clear, pour first the alum solution,
then the sugar of lead, into another vessel;
after several hours pour off the water, letting
any thick sediment remain, and soak the tent,
kneading it well: wring out and hang up to
dry.</p>

<p>Camp furniture I had none. A tin plate,
knife, fork and spoon for each man; a nest
of cooking pots which Thomson provided, a
small tin basin in which we washed and which
also served to mix our bread, and lastly the
invaluable portable tin baker which will roast
or bake anything. It was strange that the
Hudson Bay Stores at Vancouver could not
provide light cooking utensils suitable for
packing. They had excellent blankets, waterproof
sheets and the larger articles of camp
equipment, but light cooking utensils there
were none. Mr. Williams took infinite trouble
to get a nest of cooking pots made for me,
but on their arrival at Campbell River they
were found impossible owing to their weight,
so I made them a present to Smith.</p>

<p>We fitted out as regards provisions at Mr.
Chambers' Store: the usual articles of food&mdash;bacon,
pork, beans, tea, sugar, flour, baking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
powder, oatmeal, dried apples and peaches,
a couple of tins of meat, a couple of tins of
jam&mdash;one of which only sufficed for a meal&mdash;some
butter as a great treat, and a few potatoes
and onions on which I insisted.</p>

<p>No liquor could be purchased in Alert Bay;
the sale was prohibited on account of the
Indian Settlement. Fortunately, I had secured
two bottles of rum from the <i>Queen City</i>, or
otherwise I should have fared badly&mdash;as it
was, I had to be content with about a dessertspoonful
of rum each night before turning in.
It is said that the Indians will do anything
for liquor, and once they get hold of any, drink
without any self-restraint. At Campbell River
I had more than once seen an Indian lying on
the side of the road hopelessly drunk and
insensible. It is therefore a wise provision
that the sale of liquor should be prohibited
at Alert Bay. The settlement was full of
Indians and their squaws, and a very unattractive
lot the squaws were. Once having
seen them, it was difficult to believe in
the immorality with which they are credited.
These Siwashes seemed a degraded race, and
one heard of men who deliberately took
their wives to logging camps to live on their
earnings.</p>

<p>The provisions we laid in were supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
last three men for twenty days, and I was
assured we would be helped out with game,
an occasional deer, ruffled grouse and plenty
of fish once we got into the forest.</p>

<p>A man cannot carry a pack weighing more
than eighty pounds in the country we had to
traverse, and, having cut down everything
to the absolute necessaries of life, we still had
to make double trips to get our stuff into
camp, wasting a day each time.</p>

<p>We got away in the afternoon and crossed
the Straits to the mouth of the Nimquish
River in an Indian canoe. About a mile up
the river was the comfortable log house of
B. Lansdown, a settler. We were lucky
enough to find him at home and he agreed to
be the third man of our party. At first the
idea was that he should help to pack in about
three marches to where we proposed to make a
permanent camp, and then return; but subsequent
events compelled us to keep him the
whole time. He was a fourth mouth to feed
and at all times had a most excellent appetite.</p>

<p>Having arranged with two Siwash Indians
to take us up to the lake, a distance of about
seven miles, the following morning, we accepted
Lansdown's invitation to put up at his house,
where we were most hospitably entertained.</p>

<p>After some food at 5 o'clock I had my first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
experience of a Vancouver forest. A cougar
had been killing cattle in the immediate
neighbourhood, and Smith's and Dick's services
were requisitioned to bring him to book.</p>

<p>Crossing the river, we were soon in the
densest and most impenetrable undergrowth
I ever attempted to crawl through. We were
shown the spot where the last kill had taken
place, and though we spent till dusk scrambling
over and under fallen trees and through a tangle
of undergrowth, unable to see five yards ahead,
Dick could find no trace of the cougar. It
had been raining in the morning, so we were
all wet to the skin, as forcing our way through
the undergrowth was like taking a shower
bath. Hunting the cougar is, in my opinion,
unworthy of the name of sport. Success
depends on having a good dog to follow up
the cougar by scent and to drive him up a
tree, when the hunter comes up and pots him.
Why such a powerful animal&mdash;for he is as big
as a panther&mdash;should be such a coward, I
cannot understand. I never heard while on
the coast of a single case where the cougar
attacked a man. The dog he sometimes goes
for, and Dick had been once severely mauled.</p>

<p>I confess my first attempt at hunting in
the Vancouver forest was most disappointing,
as I had formed no idea of the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
forest we were to hunt in. Several people
at the Campbell River Hotel had asked me
if I knew what I was "up against" in deciding
to try for a wapiti. Some, including my men,
took a brighter view, and assured me that the
dense undergrowth was only on the coast,
and that as one got inland the forest became
more open. Had I known what I was really
"up against," I think I would have turned
back, for never have I endured greater discomfort.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

IN THE FOREST</h2>


<p>The morning of the 29th was fine and the
river was looking lovely in the brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p>Just before the Indians with their canoes
arrived, a doe deer came down on to the shingle
across the river. As we required meat, neither
sex nor season was taken into consideration.
My rifle was not ready, so Smith had a shot
at about 120 yards and missed. I then had
a try and missed the deer, which stood without
moving, but with a second shot I brought her
down. In a moment "Nigger" was into the
river and across worrying the carcass&mdash;what
for I could not understand, for the poor beast
was stone dead. It was lucky we secured this
meat, for it was the last we saw for many days;
but we afterwards regretted our generosity
in leaving half the carcass behind as a present
to our host's family.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the big Siwash canoe, with
two Indians to pole, we loaded up our kit and
at last were off on our trip. Smith went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
through the forest on the chance of seeing any
game, when he was to communicate with me.
Lansdown and Thomson went up in Lansdown's
canoe, but spent most of their time
in the water hauling it over the many rapids.
My Indians were splendid boatmen and poled
up all but one of the rapids. The river has a
considerable fall from the lake, and heavy
rapids and miniature cataracts alternate with
deep pools&mdash;an ideal fishing water.</p>

<p>Without stopping to fish, I trailed a small
Tacomah spoon behind the canoe and got
twelve cut-throat trout, weighing 9 lb., by the
time we entered the lake.</p>

<p>The scenery, as pure river scenery, was
superb the whole way, the banks being clothed
with dense forest through which the river
rushed and tumbled on its short course to
the sea. It reminded me very much of the
scenery on the Kippewa River in Eastern
Canada. The river opened out as we approached
the lake, and the scenery as we entered
the lake was, if possible, more beautiful
than that we had passed through.</p>

<p>To the south extended the Nimquish Lake
as far as the eye could see. The perennial
snow of the Vancouver Mountains formed an
impressive background, while a dense forest
clothed the sides of the steep hills, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
some places fell almost perpendicularly down
to the lake. The evening was lovely, the lake
without a ripple, mountain and forest reflected
as in a mirror. The whole scene gave a feeling
of peace which can only be found in
communion with nature.</p>

<p>Camp and dinner took our thoughts away
in a more practical direction, and leaving
Smith and Thomson to pitch camp, Lansdown
and I started for the lake end of the river to
secure a few more trout for the pot.</p>

<p>There was the most extraordinary collection
of driftwood on the beach&mdash;colossal trees
lying packed across one another, showing
how high the lake must rise when the torrents
descend from the precipitous mountains.</p>

<p>On our return, we found Smith and Thomson
had pitched camp in the forest near the lake,
but the ground was sodden and covered with
a thick moss. No drier spot could be found,
so we had to make the best of it. The mosquitoes
were troublesome till sunset, when they
disappeared. I had the same experience during
the entire trip. Very often unbearable the
hour before sunset, they disappeared as night
closed in, and I never had occasion to use a
mosquito curtain. The nights were cold, which
perhaps accounted for it.</p>

<p>I could not help contrasting the camp and
its arrangements with my camping experience
in Eastern Canada, some seven years before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
There we had ideal camping grounds, on the
bank of some river or lake, dry sandy soil, a
fairly open forest with undergrowth only in
parts, and lovely views from the tent door over
rushing river or placid lake. I had French
Canadians for companions and guides and they
have a perfect genius for making comfortable
and even luxurious camps; unlimited supplies,
for we travelled with two canoes, and most of
our way was over lakes or rivers with short
portages; a comfortable tent, and if we were
to camp for two or three days, my men soon
ran up a dining-table and bench under a birch
bark shelter. The table was always laid with
a clean napkin, and an excellent dinner of
soup, fish, stuffed ruffled grouse, deliciously
cooked, was served. We had plenty of knives,
forks, plates and drinking cups&mdash;in fact, all
the comfort which two canoes allow.</p>

<p>Here, we had only once a decent camp, and
that was on Lake Keogh. The edges of the
lake were generally swamps and piled up with
driftwood. Our camps had to be pitched in
the forest, a short distance from the shore of
the lake, or on the bank of the river on the
most level bit of land we could find. The
ground was always sodden, and a few branches
of damp hemlock with a waterproof sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
spread over them was my bed. We each had
a tin plate, cup, knife, fork and spoon. We
all ate together, sitting on the damp ground
in front of the camp fire. Lastly, the comforting
tot of whisky at or after dinner had to
be abandoned, for we had only two bottles
of rum in case of illness.</p>

[<i>To face page 92.</i></div>
</div>

<p>At the first camp we fared quite luxuriously,
for we had the venison we had brought along
and the trout I had caught <i>en route</i>&mdash;but later
on, the daily fare of bacon and beans became,
to say the least, monotonous. In one thing
we were lucky: Thomson baked the most
delicious bread; so we were certain of good
bread and tea.</p>

<p>The morning of the 30th broke fine and we
got away about 8.30 a.m., but before long the
rain came down and we plodded along through
the forest for some seven hours, during which
we did not cover much more than three miles.</p>

<p>The undergrowth was nearly everywhere
dense, consisting of wine-berries and that
curse of the forest, the thorny devil-club.
The trees rose from one to two hundred feet
in height over our heads. Windfalls of timber
were numerous, adding to the difficulty of
the march.</p>

<p>Of animal life we could see nothing. Deer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
marks were plentiful, and in the early morning
before starting we heard the melancholy howling
of two wolves. Game might have been
in abundance, but what was the good when it
was impossible to see more than a few yards
ahead. I began to have serious misgivings
as to what stalking a wapiti would be like in
such a country. The wapiti country was,
however, far away and we had still to get
there.</p>

<p>About 4 o'clock we pitched camp, if possible
on a worse ground than that of the day before.</p>

<p>Packs for two men had been left behind to be
brought on next day, which meant that I had
to remain in camp on the 31st with nothing
to do, for there was neither game nor fish in
the neighbourhood. Smith went on to find
the way for next day's march, and the
other two men went back to bring up the
loads left behind. They turned up about
7 p.m. Smith got back in the afternoon,
having found Kitsewa River, which was to be
our objective the next day.</p>

<p>About 5 p.m. the rain came down in torrents
and continued all night. Fortunately my little
tent was quite waterproof. One great advantage
of a camp in the forest is that there is
no wind to drive the rain through the tent.
I doubt whether my tent would have kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
out such rain if the camp had been in the
open.</p>

<p>September 1st. The rain stopped about
5 a.m. but the trees and undergrowth were
dripping and a bad wet march was before us.</p>

<p>Getting away about 8.30 a.m.&mdash;it was always
difficult to get the men to make an earlier
start&mdash;we were soon wet to the skin. Smith,
having got the compass bearings of the river,
tried to find a better route than that he had
taken the day before; but towards the end
of the march we hit on a very bad windfall
on the slope of a steep hill. Giant trees lay
in a dense tangle, over, under and across
which we had to make our way. It was timber
crawling at its worst, and the trunks of the
trees being covered with damp, slippery moss
made the going really dangerous at times.
Unfortunately I was wearing a pair of strong
shooting boots with Scafe's patent rubber
studs instead of nails. They had no hold
on the slippery trunks of the trees we had to
cross; the result was a bad fall and a sprained
knee which caused me great pain and discomfort
for the rest of the trip. I shall never
forget the end of that march, for my knee
kept giving way, and I stumbled and tumbled
about till I was covered with bruises.</p>

<p>We made the Kitsewa River after six hours'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
march, and as the rain again set in, we camped
at a disused trapper's hut on a high bank
overlooking the river. The river here was
about thirty yards broad and full of humpbacked
salmon, but apparently no trout. We
had seen many tracks of deer, wolves and one
cougar on the march, but the undergrowth
was so dense that shooting was impossible.</p>

<p>September 2nd. The men had again to go
back to bring up the packs left behind. These
double journeys were most annoying, and yet
I do not see how they could have been avoided.
We certainly only had the bare necessaries of
life&mdash;more packers would have meant more
mouths to feed and more provisions to carry&mdash;yet
each double journey meant a lost day.</p>

<p>My knee was so swollen and painful I could
not move from the tent, so Smith decided to
go on and hunt for the Keogh Lake&mdash;where
his brother Eustace had on a previous trip
left the material for a rough raft; where the
Keogh Lake was, he was not quite certain,
but it had to be found.</p>

<p>Left alone in camp I could not help thinking
what would have happened had I broken my
leg. Putting the question to the men they
said, "Oh! it would have been all right&mdash;we
would have packed in food to you." In
fact I would have had to lie in my tent till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
recovered or died, for it is impossible to move
a sick or injured man through the Vancouver
forest. With nothing to read and obliged to
lie on my back, the day was long in passing,
and I find the following entry in my diary:
"Knee very painful, am quite unable to walk
and miserable at the idea that my entire trip
may be spoiled and that I may have to turn
back. Am black and blue with bruises from
the many falls I had yesterday after I injured
my knee."</p>

<p>Smith had succeeded in getting one willow
grouse, shooting it with a pistol, but he
missed two others close to the camp. The
men returned about 4 o'clock, having made
good time, as we had blazed our track of yesterday.
Smith got in about 7 p.m., utterly exhausted,
and having failed to find Lake Keogh.</p>

<p>Here was a man, certainly one of the best
woodsmen in the island, defeated by the difficulties
of the Vancouver forest. It must be
remembered the northern portions of the
Island are unsurveyed, so marching was all
compass work. There had probably been
some slight error in the bearings given him
by his brother, but the fact remained, that
Keogh Lake had still to be hunted for.</p>

<p>Dick had found a cougar and Smith shot
him&mdash;a fine specimen of a male. Smith's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
appearance with the skin fastened over his
shoulder was certainly dramatic, rendered
more so by his throwing himself on the ground
in a state of utter exhaustion. Here the
rum came in useful, and after a good tot and
some food, he was quite himself again. I
think he felt bitterly that he had failed to find
the lake, but he had done his best, and no man
can do more.</p>

<p>September 3rd. My knee was still painful
and I was quite unfit to march. It was useless
to start without knowing where we were going,
so after consultation we decided that Smith
and Thomson should go ahead and try to find
the lake. As it turned out Smith had gone
too far east the previous day.</p>

<p>Lansdown and "Nigger" remained in
camp, but Dick, who must have been pretty
tired after yesterday's work, refused to leave
his master.</p>

<p>Cutting a strong stick&mdash;my daily companion
for the rest of the trip&mdash;I hobbled down to
the river to try and get some fish for ourselves
and the dogs.</p>

<p>There were shoals of humpbacked salmon
in the pools, but they were hideous to look at,
as the spawning season was coming on. They
would not look at a fly or minnow, so I had
resort to the worst form of poaching: "sniggering."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
I soon had five on the bank and could
as easily have had fifty. To us the fish were
quite uneatable, but the dogs thoroughly
enjoyed them. I could see no sign of trout
of any size or in any number. I only caught
one tiny cut-throat. Dead humpbacks were
lying in all the pools, and along the banks of
the river; there were tracks of a big bear close
to camp and many deer tracks, but the dense
undergrowth destroyed any chance of a shot.</p>

<p>Returning to camp about 6 p.m. I set out
for a grassy hollow, fairly open and close to
the river where Lansdown said deer were
certain to come out to feed in the evening.
I stood the mosquitoes for about five minutes
when I had to retire ignominiously, as they
were simply in clouds.</p>

<p>Night fell and there was no sign of Smith
or Thomson. Fortunately the weather had
been quite perfect and a bivouac in the woods
would be no great hardship.</p>

<p>"Nigger" was a source of continual amusement
to me that day. He was a dog of great
character and had become much attached to
me. He liked the camp fire and never was so
happy as when sitting on his haunches as close
as he could get to it and blinking with intense
joy. His master, I fear, often drove him away,
but he always crept back a few minutes after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
He loved, too, to crawl under the fly of my tent
and curl up for the night at the foot of my
blanket.</p>

<p>I spent a portion of the day cleaning and
skinning the paws of the cougar, and as I
finished each paw, threw it away some distance
from the camp. "Nigger" carefully watched
my proceedings, and when he thought I was not
looking, slunk away and had soon retrieved
each paw, and carefully buried it for future
use. Poor beast! I expect he had experienced
many a hungry day and instinct had
taught him to make provision for the future.</p>

<p>September 4th. Smith and Thomson had
not returned, which meant another wasted
day. Here we were the sixth day out from the
lake, but we had only made two marches and
were not yet in our hunting ground. Eustace
Smith had said it was only a two or three
days' march at the outside&mdash;but he probably
travelled alone, very light, and knew his way.
The two men turned up about 3 p.m., pretty
well tired out, as they had been walking all
the day before and from 6 o'clock in the
morning. They reported the country ahead
very bad going, but they had found a river
which must have had its source in the Keogh
Lake; the lake itself they had not reached.
I had caught about a dozen salmon parr, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
had a poor fry as an addition to the never
varying menu of bacon and beans.</p>

<p>September 5th. We did not yet get away
till 9.30, as the men were tired after their
two days' tramp. We followed the bed of
the Kitsewa River, crossing and recrossing
the stream several times, which was very
tiring. Fortunately the water was only above
our knees, but a slip with his pack gave
Lansdown a real ducking. Though the going
was bad over rough boulders, still it was a
relief after the struggle through the undergrowth
of the forest. The packs were heavy,
as we were now packing everything, so our
progress was somewhat slow. We had cachéd
some provisions in the trapper's hut and had
got through six days' supplies, still the packs
were as heavy as the men could well manage
and a rest every fifteen minutes was necessary.</p>

<p>Leaving the river after about two miles, we
again struck some bad country, and at 4 p.m.
arrived at the stream supposed to flow out of
Lake Keogh. The men were pretty well done
from the extra heavy packs, so a halt was
decided on and we pitched camp as best as
could on the side of a precipitous hill. My
knee was very painful; marching was anything
but a pleasure and I was glad of an early rest.</p>

<p>Smith went ahead and came back reporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the lake only half-a-mile away, so it was a
pity we had not gone on a little further. He
had also seen the track of a big bull wapiti
and a fresh bear track, which news cheered
us all up.</p>

<p>September 6th. Starting early we were
soon on the shore of the lake&mdash;a lovely sheet
of water about two miles long, surrounded by
steep forest-clad hills a few hundred feet high.
The growth round the shore was so thick,
and the rocks in parts so precipitous, we decided
it would save time to build a raft to get
to the end of the lake. We found some logs
with which Eustace Smith had made a raft
and soon put them together, and had a rough
raft on which we paddled slowly to the north
end of the lake.</p>

<p>We pitched camp on the first decent camping
ground we had found. The men were in shelter
under an enormous cedar-tree, of great age
and quite hollow in the middle. My tent was
pitched on an open bit of ground running out
to the lake, over which I had a beautiful view.</p>

<p>Misfortune was still to pursue us&mdash;Smith
had had a bad fall two days before, but did
not attach much importance to it. He now
felt very ill and complained of great pain and
tenderness in his side. On examining him,
it appeared to me that one of his ribs was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
cracked if not broken. He was not a very
strong man physically, though as hard as nails.
All we could do was to foment his side with
one of our flannel shirts and let him lie
in his blankets near the fire, which had been
lit at the base of the cedar-tree.</p>

<p>There were some open glades at the end of
the lake and the country looked more gamelike.
I went out in the afternoon to have a
look round. The country was more open and
I found a two-day-old track of a big bull, so
game was in the neighbourhood&mdash;there were
also fresh bear tracks and bear droppings
close to camp.</p>

<p>I returned to try for a dish of trout while
Thomson went out to lie in wait for deer coming
out to feed at sunset&mdash;a form of sport I did
not appreciate.</p>

<p>The question of food was now becoming
serious, as the men had calculated on plenty
of deer and grouse, and we had had no fresh
meat since the deer I shot the day we started
up the Nimquish River. Fishing from the
shore and from our raft I caught six cut-throat
trout, the largest about half-a-pound, with
the fly. The lake was very deep and peaty&mdash;no
doubt there were bigger fish in it, but they
would not rise freely; it was late in the season
and possibly my flies were not big enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomson returned, having wounded a deer&mdash;I
don't think he was a crack shot, but like all
the men I met on the coast, very fond of loosing
off. He also reported having met a bear which
he missed clean, but doubt was expressed in
camp as to the bear.</p>

<p>September 7th. The rain was coming down
in torrents and the camp most uncomfortable,
while to move on was impossible, as Smith was
feverish and in considerable pain, quite unfit
to carry a pack. I had, therefore, most
reluctantly to decide to remain where we were.</p>

<p>Thomson took "Nigger" out to find the
wounded deer and returned in the evening
successful. The deer was a young doe. There
was great joy in camp at the prospect of a
meat meal at last, for we had had no fresh
meat since August 29th.</p>

<p>During the night we had an alarm. The
men had pitched their fly under a very old
cedar-tree and the camp fire was lit against
the tree, which was hollow. About midnight
there was a sound of an explosion and a roar
of flames. Jumping out of bed, a most extraordinary
sight presented itself; the entire tree
was in flames from the base to the summit.
The fire had evidently crept up the hollow
trunk till the whole tree was ablaze.</p>

<p>Pulling down the fly, the men saved everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from being burnt, but morning found the
tree still a roaring pillar of fire.</p>

<p>In Eastern Canada in the fall of the year
such an occurrence might have set the whole
country ablaze and resulted in one of those
tracts of burnt country called "brulés" so
common through that country. While on
the Campbell River we heard of great forest
fires taking place on the Mainland, but in the
north of Vancouver Island I saw no sign of a
burnt forest, for it was too saturated to burn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

IN THE WAPITI COUNTRY</h2>


<p>September 8th. We got away in fine
weather through the most open country we
had yet met. Our objective was a lake about
three miles away, for having found Keogh
Lake, Eustace Smith's rough-sketch map now
came in useful.</p>

<p>The country looked more promising for game,
for we came across many well-beaten wapiti
tracks and at least two fresh tracks of good
bulls.</p>

<p>We got into camp fairly early and selected
the most level piece of ground to be found
some twenty yards from the lake; the edge
of the lake itself was swampy.</p>

<p>The lake was about a mile long by a quarter
of a mile broad. It was the first of a chain of
lakes connected by a narrow stream with a
rough rocky bed running to the west. The
sides were clothed with dense forest and the
tops of the surrounding hills were even now
covered with snow.</p>

<p>The view in the morning was most beautiful
&mdash;the mist floating up the forest-clad ravines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to the distant hill-tops all reflected in the glassy
surface of the lake. At sunset it was equally
lovely.</p>

<p>This lake we called No. 1, as we understood
the chain consisted of three lakes extending
westward down the valley which was to be our
future hunting ground.</p>

<p>Smith suggested he should go out, look
quietly round, examine the country and search
for fresh tracks, so that we could begin our
regular hunting the next day.</p>

<p>Being now in the game country I had given
strict orders that no one was to shoot at anything,
but to come back and report what he
had seen&mdash;I was therefore somewhat astounded
to hear a single shot at no great distance as I
was catching a dish of trout for dinner.</p>

<p>Smith soon came back looking very dejected.
He said he had come on fresh tracks of a good
bull, and in following them up saw something
brown in the undergrowth which he thought
was a small deer, and as we wanted meat in
camp he took a snapshot at it, and then found
it was the bull and he feared he had wounded it.</p>

<p>I had to accept this story, improbable as
it was, for there was no mistaking a great bull
wapiti for a small deer.</p>

</div>

<p>What was done was done, and there was no
use making a fuss. If I were making such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
trip again, I would ask the men to leave their
rifles behind, for they cannot resist shooting at
anything that comes their way.</p>

<p>He had come back at once to tell me, and
begged of me to go out with him and take
up the track, which was only about a mile
away.</p>

<p>The rain was again falling and we had only
a couple of hours of daylight, but still I decided
to see for myself the tracks and ascertain, if
possible, whether the bull had been wounded
and where. Taking Thomson with us, we
started and were soon as usual wet through.</p>

<p>We found the spot where Smith had come on
the bull and fired. There were a few traces of
blood, but they were all high up on the bushes,
and from the pace the wapiti was travelling,
it was evident he was none the worse for the
light bullet of Smith's Winchester rifle.</p>

<p>We followed the track till dusk and had a
weary tramp back to camp in the dark.</p>

<p>I had again ricked my knee and was in
considerable pain. Everything seemed to have
gone wrong, first my accident, then Smith's,
and now a wounded wapiti that we might
never find.</p>

<p>The prospect of the morrow's work with a
swollen and painful knee was not very cheering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and I think we were all rather sad when we
turned in that night.</p>

<p>September 9th. It had rained all night and
was still pelting when we started. I had to
walk with a stick and was unable to carry my
own rifle.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours we came to the spot
where we had left the track the previous
evening.</p>

<p>Smith was a fine tracker, I have seldom seen
a better.</p>

<p>The bull was going strong and well. We soon
came to where he had rested for the night, but
there was no pool of blood, so the wound was
evidently not serious. In the early morning
he had fed down the valley. After about three
hours' tracking we came on to the shore of
another lake (Lake No. 2), and thought the
bull had taken to the water&mdash;to the edge of
which he had gone down through heavy
swampy ground covered with coarse grass.
Taking a cast round, we found, however, that
he had turned right back and gone up the valley
we had just come down, but on the other side
of the river connecting the two lakes.</p>

<p>Following up the track we suddenly heard a
crash right ahead, but I could see nothing.
Smith dashed on and I heard a shout at the
top of his voice, "Come on, Sir John. Quick!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
It was all very well "come on quick," but
with a bad knee, getting through a mass of
fallen timber up a fairly steep though fortunately
short hill was no easy matter. How
I did it I cannot even now understand, but
the pain in the knee was forgotten, my stick
thrown away, the rifle, which was of course
loaded, snatched out of Thomson's hand, and
I found myself on the crest of the hill looking
down into a valley overgrown with dense
salmon-berry through which some great beast
was crashing his way.</p>

<p>I am quite blind without a telescope sight
and there was no time to fix it. I could just
make out the tips of the bull's horns moving
quickly through the undergrowth. I could
only guess where the body was, but fortunately
the body of a wapiti is a pretty big
mark. Taking a snapshot as I would at a
snipe I heard the welcome thud of the bullet.
The bull stood for a moment, which gave me
time for a second shot, on which I saw the great
antlers sink out of sight in the undergrowth and
I knew that the trophy I had come so far to
obtain was mine.</p>

<p>I confess to an anxious moment as to what
the head would turn out to be. The tracks
were those of a big bull, but I had only seen the
tips of the horn; the spread looked good, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
whether he was a six or a sixteen points I
could not say.</p>

<p>Going down to where he lay we found him
stone dead, a good thirteen-pointer, which the
men naturally declared to be above the
average. Somehow, I was disappointed, as I
expected a bigger head, but after all getting
him at all was a pure chance, and having now
experienced what hunting the wapiti in these
dense forests meant, I was, I think, on the
whole very lucky. He looked an enormous
beast as he lay. What his weight was I could
not guess, but he must have stood about
sixteen hands at the shoulder. It took the
three of us all we could do to turn him over to
examine the wounds.</p>

<p>Both of my shots were fatal. We found
that Smith's bullet had inflicted a flesh wound
high up in the rump, and would have done no
harm.</p>

<p>Wet to the skin, but happy, I got under a
giant cedar which gave shelter from the heavy
rain, and lighting a big fire, stripped to the
skin to dry my soaking clothes, while the men
were removing the head and getting some meat.
We soon had wapiti steaks frizzling on the fire,
and a brew of hot tea made us all comfortable
and happy.</p>

<p>The worst of the whole business was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
waste of meat and the impossibility of taking
away the splendid skin. The head alone was
one man's load and to carry out a green skin
was quite impossible.</p>

<p>Packing as much of the meat as we could
carry, we made for the camp.</p>

<p>The creek flowing down the valley was
coming down in heavy spate and we had to
cross and recross it many times&mdash;no easy
matter&mdash;before we got home.</p>

<p>September 10th. It was still raining. Smith
was feeling pretty bad, his side causing him
much pain, and he was, I think, beginning to
feel anxious about himself. My knee was
anything but comfortable. Neither of us were
up to another day in the forest, so I spent my
day fishing and caught about forty small cut-throat
trout, the biggest about 3 oz. I saw
one fish about 2 lb. throw himself in the lake,
but he would not rise when I put a fly over him;
it was possibly too late in the season. This
lake had practically never been fished, and I
was much disappointed to find that the sport
was so poor.</p>

<p>Lansdown had gone back to bring up a small
pack left at Keogh Lake. He returned in the
evening, reporting that he had come face to
face with a ten-pointer bull who simply looked
at him and walked away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is luck. Happily he had not a rifle,
or most certainly he would have loosed
off.</p>

<p>September 11th. Our future plans had now
to be discussed and decided on.</p>

<p>Instead of two or three days' march, we had
owing to a chapter of accidents taken ten days
to get into the wapiti country. Provisions
were running short. Smith was practically
<i>hors de combat</i> and feeling worse every day,
and yet viewing the fact that we were now
in the wapiti country, and by spending another
few days we might reasonably expect to get
another bull, I was extremely unwilling to
turn back.</p>

<p>On the other hand, further exposure in the
vile weather we were experiencing might have
resulted in Smith's serious illness. Not liking
to assume the responsibility, I left it to him.
He reluctantly decided for home. I feel sure
he was even more disappointed than I was,
for he was a keen sportsman, but in his present
condition he was quite unfit to carry a pack,
while serious illness might have resulted from
exposure to pouring rain. The decision was
the only one that could be come to, so there
was no use in repining.</p>

<p>We accordingly sent Thomson and Lansdown
back to Keogh Lake with the wapiti head and
one pack. Smith and I started out on our last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
chance of finding another wapiti.</p>

<p>It was for a wonder a lovely morning, and I
felt bitterly the hard luck which had pursued
us all the way, and which now compelled us to
turn back just as we had reached a game
country. We went up a fine valley running
from the east of the lake&mdash;the most open
forest we had yet come to. It was timbered
with magnificent spruce-trees, some of which
I should say were at least 180 feet in height.
There was but little undergrowth, it was the
first ideal hunting ground we had struck. We
worked all the morning without finding anything
but two-day-old tracks. After lunch
we suddenly came on quite fresh tracks of a
good bull, possibly the one Lansdown had seen
the day before.</p>

<p>Taking up the tracks, we followed steadily
on and must have come close enough to disturb
him, though we neither heard nor saw anything.
We came, however, on the spot where he had
been lying down and had jumped up and
gone off at a gallop.</p>

<p>We tracked that bull till dusk and never
came up with him. Fortunately he took us
down the valley to the lake where we were
camped, and we got home at nightfall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

OUT OF THE FOREST</h2>


<p>September 12th was a lovely crisp morning
with a touch of frost in the air. The lake
was looking perfect as we turned our backs on
it, leaving the game country and all the
chances of another wapiti behind. It was hard
luck and I think we were all more or less
depressed.</p>

<p>We made a good march down the Spruce
valley till we struck Keogh Lake in the early
afternoon. This was the route by which we
should have come in, as it was fairly open, more
so than any other portion of the forest we had
gone through. The timber was very fine. A
small creek ran down the valley, and along it
there were many beaver dams.</p>

<p>Beavers are still protected by law throughout
the island. We saw a large one swimming
across Keogh Lake when in camp on our way
in, and at night more than once heard the
curious noise the beaver makes striking the
water with his tail as he dives when frightened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Needless to say, regardless of all game laws, the
men had several shots at the beaver without
doing him any harm.</p>

<p>Arriving at our old camp at Keogh Lake we
found the cedar still smouldering. Having
made a new raft we reached camp at the south
end of the lake, just as the sky clouded up,
evidently preparing for another downpour.</p>

<p>The shores of the Lake were swampy and it
was with difficulty we found a place to camp.
It rained that night as if it had never rained
before.</p>

<p>Lansdown now jacked up and I find the
following note in my diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Smith still ill and Lansdown now sick
and very sorry for himself&mdash;query, too much
wapiti meat&mdash;we are a sorry crew, but my knee
is free from pain for the first time since the
accident occurred."</p>

<p>In all the discomforts I was to be "up
against," none of my friends had mentioned
the possibility of bad weather in September.</p>

<p>August at the Campbell River had been
simply an ideal climate, but from August 30th
to September 26th, it had rained fifteen days
out of the twenty-eight, and by rain I don't
mean showers, which were common and did
not count, but a steady downpour which
lasted all day, and made marching through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
undergrowth, alike on fine or wet days, like
going under a continual shower bath.</p>

<p>September 13th. It was still raining heavily
and the men were not very keen on starting.
Carrying a pack in wet weather is hard work
and apt to chafe the back. On the other hand,
I had no prospect of more sport and did not
care to pay my men 13&frac12; dollars a day that
they should rest in camp till the weather
cleared. I determined, therefore, to move on,
but it was noon before I could get a move on
the men, and it required some determination
to effect this. It was certainly a miserable
march, steady rain the whole time. About 3
o'clock the men gave up and said they could
pack no further in such weather.</p>

<p>We had struck the Kitsewa, which was rushing
down in heavy flood, so camped on its bank.</p>

<p>Thomson was now feeling seedy, and every
one was out of sorts and a bit out of temper at
the vile weather.</p>

<p>September 14th. The river was down about
a foot but still very full. After crossing and
recrossing it about ten times and getting wet
through, we arrived at our old camp at the
trapper's hut about 1 p.m.; a short but fatiguing
march owing to the state of the river.
We had intended pushing on further after our
midday meal, but once more torrential rains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
had set in and we decided to remain where we
were for the day.</p>

<p>The river was now simply alive with humpbacked
salmon and dozens were lying dead on
the banks. Bear marks were numerous, but
the dense undergrowth rendered any chance
of seeing one remote. "Nigger" was revelling
in his pursuit of fish and repeatedly dashed
into the shallows which were boiling with
salmon struggling up stream, bringing out a
fish each time, one must have been about six
pounds. On the march "Dick" had come on
the fresh track of two wolves and promptly
started after them. He gave us some anxiety
for the half-hour he was away, for with all his
pluck, he would have had a poor chance if he
had come up with them. I suppose it was the
deserted hut which recalled to Lansdown's
mind a grim tale of a trapper's fate.</p>

<p>The man had started out from civilization
on his usual winter expedition. Spring came
and he failed to return, but this did not cause
any anxiety as trappers lead a nomadic life,
and it was thought he might have pushed
further than he intended or found some specially
good hunting ground. Two years passed
and his existence had been practically forgotten,
when a party cruising the woods for
timber came on a log hut in a lonely part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the forest. Inside they found a man's skeleton
lying on the little shelf which constituted
the bed. By the side was a rifle and the bony
hand still grasped a twig attached to the
trigger, a shattered skull told the rest of the
tale.</p>

<p>On a bench beside the bed were the tin
plates, a cup and the mouldy remains of what
once had been food.</p>

<p>What a tragedy! One could picture illness
coming on and the struggle against it. Too
weak to pack out, he eventually had to take
to bed&mdash;at first possibly able to get up and
cook a little food while provisions lasted&mdash;then
his strength gradually declined, the lonely
nights thinking of the inevitable end, and then
the final decision possibly hastened by hearing
the howling of wolves round the log cabin.</p>

<p>After all, his best friend was his rifle and
that was close to hand. Who can blame him
for the decision he had the courage to carry
out?</p>

<p>Lansdown was one of the men sent out to
bury the remains.</p>

<p>September 15th. The morning was fine
and we got away about 8.30. Thomson announced
that the provisions had practically
run out&mdash;no more flour or sugar and we were
two days from the lake. We had actually
left some flour and other provisions behind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
order to lighten the packs.</p>

<p>Improvidence seems to characterize these
men of the west. So long as provisions are
plentiful there is no thought of the future.</p>

<p>Three spoonfuls of sugar will be put in a cup
of tea and a two-pound tin of jam will disappear
at a meal&mdash;treated as if it were stewed
fruit, but the future is forgotten.</p>

<p>To-day the poor dogs had no food at all.
We ourselves did not fare brilliantly, but a
short march on the morrow should bring us
to the Nimquish Lake. We might indeed with
an effort have made it in the day.</p>

<p>September 16th. A two hours' march took
us to the lake and our last meal was taken on
its shores. It was neither luxurious nor plentiful&mdash;a
few crusts of yesterday's bread fried in
some bacon fat which remained on the pan,
and a cup of weak tea, for tea too had run out.</p>

<p>I hunted for and found a portion of the skin
of the deer I had shot on the first day in and
which I had thrown into the lake.</p>

<p>"Dick" and "Nigger" devoured it ravenously.
Poor doggies, they had been two days
without a meal. More faithful or longsuffering
companions a man never had. They seemed to
understand we could not give them what we
had not, and while they looked at us eating
with anxious eyes, when no scraps were thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they resigned themselves to hunger and curled
up to sleep.</p>

[<i>To face page 126.</i></div>
</div>

<p>I reserve for ever a warm corner in my heart
for "Dick" and "Nigger."</p>

<p>How "Dick" found his way in the forest
was always a mystery to me. Of the keenest
sporting instinct, he considered it his duty to
pursue any track he came across. Wolf, bear
or deer were all the same to him. I fear even
a wapiti would not have been sacred, but in the
wapiti country, we always tied him up in camp.</p>

<p>Over and over again he went away giving
tongue loudly till distance drowned his barks.
He had no idea in what direction we were
marching. Sometimes he would be away for
an hour and we began to fear something had
happened to him but he invariably turned up
wagging his tail, having found our tracks and
followed them. I have seldom met a more
intelligent dog.</p>

<p>Coming out of the dense forest and suddenly
striking the open lake bathed in brilliant sunshine,
the effect was dazzling and our eyes
were almost blinded. Fortunately we saw a
Siwash canoe across the lake, and were lucky
enough to find that Mr. Dickenson, one of the
Directors of a timber company, was up on a
tour of inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>He most kindly offered to take me down the
river in his canoe, and we decided to fish a little
on the way down. In the first pool where the
river left the lake I got a couple of nice cut-throat
trout, one about 2 lb., on the fly.</p>

<p>The pool was simply alive with cohoe salmon,
which could be seen on all sides swimming
about in the clear water. Mr. Dickenson
trolling with a spoon was soon in a nice fish of
about 7 lb., which gave really good sport on a
light trout rod before it was landed.</p>

<p>Shooting the rapids in great form we were
very soon opposite Lansdown's house, where
I landed.</p>

<p>And so ended my hunting trip in the Vancouver
forests.</p>

<p>I cannot say much in its favour. It was
timber crawling pure and simple from beginning
to end&mdash;no real stalking, only a snapshot which
fortunately got me my wapiti. The weather
had been all against us&mdash;the camping grounds,
with the exception of that on Keogh Lake,
most uncomfortable. Food was indifferent
owing to difficulty of finding any game; deer
there were in numbers, judging by the tracks,
but one seldom saw them. There were ruffled
grouse, but Smith was not very successful with
his pistol, and we only got two or three the
whole trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>With the fishing I was very much disappointed.
The trout in the lakes in the interior
were tiny things, hardly worth catching
or eating.</p>

<p>So long as one has to pack, I do not see how
a really comfortable trip can be made. Discomfort
to a certain extent I don't mind, but
we had a little too much of it. I had added
one more experience to a life of varied sport,
but I mentally resolved that I never again
would be tempted to hunt the wapiti in the
Vancouver forest, or indeed, to go on any hunting
trip which depended on packing for transport.
Who knows whether I shall keep that
resolve?</p>

<p>That night we put up at Lansdown's, and
never in the best restaurants of Paris or
London have I enjoyed a meal more than that
which Mrs. Lansdown with true hospitality
placed before us, abundance of food&mdash;mutton,
potatoes, and other fresh vegetables, eggs, milk
and cream. I fear we all ate far too much.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

AFTER GOAT ON THE MAINLAND</h2>


<p>Having still a few days to spare, I decided
to try for a Rocky Mountain goat on the Mainland.</p>

<p>Lansdown had lived for some years at the
head of Kingcome Inlet, one of the great inlets
running in to the Mainland, just behind the
island on which the town of Alert Bay is
situated.</p>

<p>He stated that goats were plentiful but that
one would have to climb up to the tops of the
mountains at this season of the year. He also
pretended to an intimate knowledge of every
turn and bend of the inlet, and the best campgrounds.
I accordingly engaged him and his
sixteen-feet rowing and sailing boat for the
trip.</p>

<p>September 17th. We started early for Alert
Bay and were fortunate in getting a tow across
from the timber company's steam launch, and
arrived at Alert Bay in the early forenoon.
We laid in ample supplies of provisions at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Mr. Chambers' store and with some difficulty I
got the men to start at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>My two bottles of rum had long since been
exhausted though only taken in homoeopathic
doses. The difficulty was to get more. No
spirits were allowed to be sold in Alert Bay, a
passing steamer was the only chance, and fortunately
one was due before we started.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. Halliday saved the situation.
He as a magistrate gave me a certificate that
the rum was required on medical grounds,
without which the Captain of the steamer
would have refused to part with any. I was
the envy of the entire Indian population as I
left the steamer's side with a bottle of rum
sticking out of each of my coat pockets.</p>

<p>It was a lovely evening and though Mr.
Chambers had offered us a tow with his steam
launch, which runs to the head of the inlet
once a fortnight, if we would wait two days,
I preferred to get away rather than kick my
heels about Alert Bay.</p>

<p>Rowing up to the mouth of the inlet with a
flowing tide we made about seven miles, and
camped at 6 o'clock on a rocky islet where we
found an ideal camping ground, near which
some Siwash Indians had settled for the summer
fishing. The scenery was superb. A background<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the snow-covered mountains of the
Mainland, in the middle distance many islands
clad with wood down to the foreshore, a sea
like glass in which mountains, islands and
forests were reflected and the surface only
broken by the eddies of the flowing tide.
The sunset was glorious and the colouring
indescribable.</p>

<p>That evening, we saw a remarkable sight.
Pilot whales in schools were common at the
Campbell River, but here came a great whale
all alone ploughing his way up the inlet and
coming up every few minutes to blow&mdash;once
he threw his entire body many feet out of the
water and came down with a crash which
echoed through the surrounding islands.</p>

<p>September 18th. After a hearty breakfast
we got away about 9 a.m., but by 12.45 the
appetites of the men called for a halt. Noon
never passed without a spell for food being
proposed.</p>

<p>Trolling with a spoon and a hand line, for
I had left my rod at Alert Bay, I got a nice
cohoe of about ten pounds, and strange to say
quite good eating.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock a halt for the night was
suggested, but I would not have it, and as
Lansdown said there was a good camping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
ground some four miles away, we pushed
on.</p>

<p>The sides of the inlet were so steep that it
was only in certain places that ground where
a tent could be pitched was to be found.</p>

<p>Lansdown had lived twelve years on the
inlet, but his bump of locality was sadly deficient,
for it took us three and a half hours to
cover that four miles which must have been
nearer nine, and I had to take the oar for the
last two hours.</p>

<p>At last we reached the cove with a shelving
sandy beach, but it was pitch dark and the rain
was coming down, so I fear I was rather short
with poor Lansdown, who had kept promising
the camping ground a few yards round every
point we passed.</p>

<p>September 19th. The camping ground as
seen in the daylight was an ideal one. There
was no undergrowth, and a grassy glade in the
shelter of the great trees was a perfect site for
the tents. A head wind had got up and the
rain was still pouring down, so the prospects
were not very encouraging, but still by tacking
and rowing we made about seven miles when
we were picked up by Mr. Chambers' launch
and taken on to the head of the inlet where the
Kingcome River falls into the sea. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
scenery all up the inlet was very fine. The hills
got more and more perpendicular as the head
of the inlet was approached, and were clothed
with dense forest down to the water's edge.
Down the ravines from the hill-tops 3,000
feet high poured great waterfalls, and rain-clouds
and mist swept over the tops of the hills,
giving from time to time a glimpse of distant
snow-covered peaks some 6,000 feet high.</p>

<p>The evening was fine and by 6 o'clock we
were anchored in the river opposite a few
settlers' houses.</p>

<p>We found Lansdown's old house, somewhat
dilapidated but habitable. There was abundance
of sweet hay and it was a luxury to spread
my blanket on a hay-strewn dry wooden floor
with a rainproof roof over my head.</p>

<p>Most of the settlers, including Lansdown's
strapping brother, came round to have a chat and
to hear the news from the outside world. They
seem to have a fairly easy time chiefly raising
cattle, for the delta formed by the washed-down
detritus from the hills was a rich white soil on
which a fine crop of grass was raised. There
were a good number of wild duck about, and
the settlers were a sporting lot, so they amused
themselves with the evening flighting and with
occasional trips up Mount Kingcome, which
overshadowed the valley, after goat, deer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
bear.</p>

<p>September 20th. It was a fine morning and
the snow-covered peaks of Mount Kingcome
about 6,000 feet above us, where we hoped to
find our goats, were glistening in the morning
sun.</p>

<p>Smith was <i>hors de combat</i>&mdash;I had offered to
send him home from Alert Bay, but he said he
was quite fit to go on. I think he was a bit
nervous when he saw the climb before him, for
carrying a pack up the steep mountain was no
joke.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to secure the services
of Harry Kirby, one of the settlers who knew
the country well and he was willing to take
Smith's place; a better man after goat I could
not wish to have. He was very deaf and
somewhat outspoken. Looking me over he
said, "You are too stout for goat," which I
rather felt to be true, though the trip after
wapiti had fined me down considerably. I
was, however, in hard condition by this time,
and half-way up when we stopped for a midday
meal, he quietly remarked, "I think after
all you will do," and so my character as a
prospective goat-hunter was restored.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">MORNING MISTS ON MOUNT KINGCOME<br />
[<i>To face page 138.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Quite a good track was blazed and cleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
for about half-way up the hill, and the path
though very steep was not bad, only hard on
the men carrying the packs, so spells for rest
were fairly frequent. The last half where the
track had not been cleared was real bad going.
A great torrent swept down the bottom of the
steep ravine we were ascending, and it had to
be crossed many times, which meant a wetting.</p>

<p>The undergrowth was a dense tangle, fallen
trees blocked the path and never had we met
the accursed devil-club in such abundance.</p>

<p>All things must come to an end, and by 5
o'clock we were clear of the forest and entered
a fairly open valley, shut in on all sides by
steep cliffs. At the end of the valley rose the
snow-covered summit of Mount Kingcome
about three miles away.</p>

<p>We had been marching since 9.30 and had
ascended about 4,000 feet. We pitched camp
in the last clump of wood in the valley, and on
the side of the hill.</p>

<p>Though the forest ceased, there were dense
masses of impenetrable cover, consisting of
salmon-berry, wine-berry and devil-club, for
about a mile up the valley, after which the
ground was quite open.</p>

<p>Large patches of snow were lying on the bare
hills just above the cover&mdash;and while selecting
our camping ground, I suddenly saw a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
object moving across a snow patch about half-a-mile
across the valley.</p>

<p>Leaving Kirby and Lansdown to pitch the
camp I took Thomson with me, and getting
within about 500 yards of the snow patch, saw
what looked like a small bear, but as Thomson
said, "I never saw a bear with a long tail."
The animal was moving quickly over the snow
and getting closer every minute to a patch of
dense cover. No doubt it was a wolverine. I
had a long shot at about 400 yards and knocked
up the snow under his belly. In a moment
he was in the cover and we never saw him
again.</p>

<p>Further up towards the head of the valley
we saw a bear moving across a patch of snow,
but he, too, disappeared in the cover. Evening
was now closing in, so we turned towards camp.
About a mile away, just opposite the camp and
on some almost precipitous rocks a goat suddenly
came into view round a corner of the
rock. He must have been lying down all the
time out of sight, and it was bad luck not having
seen him before, for though to climb the face
of the cliff was impossible, we might have got
a long shot from below; as it was, by the time
we had got up to the foot of the cliff, it was too
dark to shoot, so we decide to leave him till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
next day.</p>

</div>

<p>At last I had reached a game country, having
seen a wolverine, a bear and goat in one afternoon.</p>

<p>September 21st. It had rained all night
but cleared up in the morning. Before I had
turned out, Kirby reported the wolverine
crossing the same patch of snow opposite the
camp about half-a-mile away. Slipping on a
pair of boots, I rushed out in my sleeping
clothes. Getting the glass on to the beast, I
found that this time it was a bear making
tracks for the valley we had come up, and no
doubt after the salmon which were rotting in
thousands on the bank of the river below.</p>

<p>He was into the cover before anything could
be done in the way of a stalk, and did not appear
again.</p>

<p>Examining the ground, I found the valley
extended up to the base of Mount Kingcome
for about one and a half miles. The sides were
precipitous cliffs quite impossible to climb.
The slope up to their base was clothed with
dense undergrowth, while a creek fed by the
melting snow and the rain from the surrounding
hills was tumbling noisily down below our
camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The head of the valley narrowed rapidly
until completely shut in by the mountains, the
tops of which were covered with snow. Large
patches of snow lay in the hollows of the hills
all round, never melting even in the summer
months.</p>

<p>The air was cold, but bracing, just the day
for a stalk. Spying the valley carefully, I soon
found a goat high up on the cliff to the right.
I think it must have been our friend of last
evening, who had fed along the side of the hill
to his present position up in the valley. The
ground did not look impossible, but Kirby pronounced
against it as too dangerous.</p>

<p>Higher up on a hill-top at the far end and
just on the edge of the snow, I picked up with
the glass two more goats and we decided to go
for them. It was easy going to the foot of the
hill where the valley ended, but a really stiff
climb of about one and a half hours to get up
to the patch of snow close to which we had seen
them, above the line of cover; the hill-side was
covered with a sort of heather growing between
the rocks and it was very slippery going.</p>

<p>As we arrived at the spot and were looking
everywhere for the goats, I saw two goats, a
nanny and a kid, moving away about 400 yards
off and climbing steadily up the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
cliff. We both thought they were the two we
were after, who had seen us or got our wind.</p>

<p>We were now 6,000 feet up and it was quite
cold enough without a blizzard which suddenly
set in with a bitter wind, which drove the snow
and sleet almost through one.</p>

<p>We were huddled under a sloping rock,
trying to get a little shelter, when it struck me
to send Kirby up and see if by any chance the
goats were still where we had seen them first,
as possibly the two we saw moving away were
another lot. It was lucky I did so, for he was
back in a few minutes with the good news that
our goats were feeding quietly in a hollow behind
a ridge not a hundred yards above us.</p>

<p>I never was so cold in my life, but leaving
Kirby behind, I crawled up to the top of the
ridge, and looking over saw to my delight a good
billy and two nannies feeding a hundred yards
away.</p>

<p>Getting into position for a careful shot, I
proceeded to remove the caps of my telescope
sight, which I had kept on up to the last moment
on account of the rain and the snow.</p>

<p>At the critical moment the front cap jammed,
and with my half-frozen hands it took me a
couple of minutes, which seemed hours, to get
it off. Peering over I saw the goats moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
off, they may have got our wind, for heavy
gales were eddying round the top of the hill.</p>

<p>The two nannies fortunately went first, the
billy was moving on pretty quickly behind. I
had just time to get a shot, another moment
and he would have disappeared behind some
rocks, and I heard the welcome thud of the
bullet; he stood for a moment, and as the extraordinary
vitality of the mountain goat had
been impressed on me by Kirby, I gave him a
second shot, and he came rolling down the hill
like a rabbit, stone dead.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the jamming of the cap
I would certainly have got one of the nannies as
well. He was a fine beast, much heavier and
bigger than I had expected.</p>

<p>The snow was still falling and we were both
shivering with cold. While still undecided
what to do a momentary break showed us two
more goats, one a fine billy right across the
valley and a little higher up, and as the day
was young we decided to have a try for them.
Climbing about 500 feet up, we arrived practically
at the summit and were spying as to the
best way to try a stalk, for the valley was now
disturbed and the goats were on the alert and
looking about in every direction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the snow set in worse than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
ever and blotted out any view of the hill. To
attempt a stalk on such dangerous ground
would have been madness, so we turned back
and went down to where we had left the dead
goat. The cold was now so intense we could
not remain to skin the goat, so made straight
for camp. The going on the way down was as
bad as it could be. The newly-fallen snow
lying on the heather had made it very slippery
and almost dangerous. I had many a slip
but generally landed sitting down, and arrived
at the foot of the hill bruised but thankful,
for after all I had got my goat. This was real
sport: to find your game, mark him down and
then an honest stalk, ending in a kill; but it
was stiff work and a little too much for a
man of my age.</p>

<p>We had come down about 2,000 feet,
and the snow had turned into rain, which
felt quite warm and comforting after the
blizzard on the hill-top. Kirby was so cold, he
asked leave to go ahead, and I soon saw him
running down the valley and skipping like a
goat from rock to rock. Taking it easier, I
got to camp about 5 o'clock, fairly tired out.</p>

<p>September 22nd. It rained and snowed all
night, and for the first time the little tent was
not waterproof. The weather cleared about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
8 a.m., and the morning sun broke through
the rain clouds and mists which were sweeping
away from the hill-tops; the effect was most
beautiful.</p>

<p>The hills where we had been stalking yesterday
were entirely covered with snow, and
patches were lying far down in the valley. I
sent Kirby and Lansdown up to skin the goat
and bring in the head and skin, while I made
preparations for striking the camp and going
down the mountain on their return.</p>

<p>They returned about noon, and we were just
preparing to start when I saw a bear&mdash;probably
the same one we had seen before, moving
rapidly up the valley at the foot of the cliff
and across one of the numerous patches of
snow. Seizing the rifle I dashed down, followed
by Thomson, to try and get a shot. I
left my coat, in which I always carried spare
cartridges, behind.</p>

<p>By the time I had crossed the creek, the
bear was well ahead and looked about 300 yards
away. Putting up the 300 yards sight, I knelt
down, rather breathless and shaky from my run,
and fired. The bullet knocked up the snow in
a good line but short. This started him off at
a run and he was getting farther and farther
away as I fired two more shots, which also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
struck low. My last chance was another shot
before he reached the thick cover, and, aiming
right over his back, I hit him, where I could not
say. He must have been 400 yards away
when I fired. On being hit, he stumbled forward
and turned right down hill into some
dense undergrowth which extended right down
to the creek.</p>

<p>Having only one cartridge left, I sent
Thomson back to camp for cartridges, and sat
down behind the rock from which I had fired
to await events. My impression was that he
was badly hit and that we would have to follow
him up in the cover. To my surprise, I suddenly
saw him come out of the cover and come
down to the creek. He was not more than
150 yards away and passing between a lot
of big boulders, and it looked as if he were
heading up the valley.</p>

<p>Thinking it was my last chance, I fired and
saw the bullet hit a rock just over his back.
To my horror, I then realized I had left the
telescope sight screwed up to 300 yards. Worse
luck was to follow, for the shot turned him
and he came down the creek towards me,
very slowly and looking very sick. There
was I without a cartridge and a wounded
bear apparently walking on top of me. I lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
quite quietly behind my rock, and had the
pleasure of seeing him come within thirty yards,
when he turned slowly and, crossing the creek,
entered the dense undergrowth on the other
side just as Thomson came up with the cartridges.
It was as bad a moment as I have ever
experienced in my sporting life. At first we
could trace his movements by the shaking of
the bushes, and at one time, this ceasing, he
apparently lay down.</p>

<p>I knew it was hopeless following him in such
undergrowth, for not only was there the danger
of being charged, but if even I could have made
my way through the tangle, it would have been
impossible to put the rifle to my shoulder.
Thomson would not give him up, but begged
I would lend him my rifle and he would follow
him up.</p>

<p>I returned to camp utterly disgusted, and in
about one hour Thomson returned, saying he
had crawled through the cover, found lots of
blood, saw the bear once in the distance, but
could not get a shot. The worst of it was, it
was now too late to start, and to make matters
more depressing, rain and sleet fell all the
afternoon and night.</p>

<p>September 23rd. The rain had now turned
to snow, which was lying as low down as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
level of the camp. Everything was sodden,
and a wet march was before us.</p>

<p>We got away by 9 o'clock, and had a
hard march as the creek was now a roaring
torrent, which we had to cross and recross
several times. Going on the rough boulders,
over and round which the flood was pouring,
was as bad as it well could be, and we were all
wet through by the time we reached the cleared
track. Our last view of the valley, before we
entered the forest, was superb. The rain had
cleared away, a bright sun was breaking
through the heavy clouds, which were being
swept away from the summits of the snow-clad
hills and from the slopes of the valley, now
dazzling white in the morning sun, while looking
back through the forest we were just entering
the trees stood out in black silhouette against
a background of snow. It was with deep
regret I turned my back on the Goat Valley,
where I had seen more game in two days than
in all the rest of my trip.</p>

<p>By 3 o'clock we reached the Kingcome
River, but it was too late to make a start that
night.</p>

<p>September 24th. We got away at 8.15.
The morning was fine, and the inlet and snow-covered
peaks behind looked very beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The current always runs down this inlet irrespective
of the tide, though it is, of course,
stronger with the ebb. We made only one
halt for lunch, and by 7.15 p.m. reached
Quiesden&mdash;a deserted Indian village thirty
miles from the head of the inlet; not a bad
performance, as we had to row the whole
way.</p>

<p>Here we found an empty mission house, and
Lansdown somewhat burglariously effected an
entrance through a window and opened the
door from inside. We soon had a fire going in
the dilapidated stove, and settled down comfortably
for the night on the bare boards.
They were at least dry and we had a roof over
our heads. The walls of the sitting-room were
mostly decorated with texts, but a coloured
illustration representing a young naval officer
making violent love to an extremely pretty
girl showed that even missionaries have a
human side to their nature.</p>

<p>The village was entirely deserted, all the
inhabitants being away fishing. There were
some fine totem poles, and the woods all round
were the cemetery of the neighbourhood&mdash;the
bodies of many departed Siwashes, packed in
boxes or bundles, being slung up in the forks
of the trees&mdash;the Siwash method of burial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>September 25th. Leaving Quiesden at 8.15,
we had a fine sailing breeze which before night
had increased to half a gale, and on arrival at
Alert Bay, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon,
Mr. Chambers most hospitably put me up till
my old friend the <i>Queen City</i>, due at 1 a.m.,
should arrive.</p>

<p>September 26th. The <i>Queen City</i> did not
arrive till noon, and bidding good-bye to my
kind friends at Alert Bay and to Lansdown,
who was returning to his farm on the Nimquish,
we were soon on our way to Vancouver.</p>

<p>Accounts had to be made up and good-bye
said to Smith and Thomson and my dear
friends "Dick" and "Nigger," for they were
all to be landed at some unearthly hour in the
morning at Quatiaski Cove. All the roughing
was over, and the comforts of civilization were
before me, yet it was with sincere regret that
I saw the last of my friends and companions.
The discomforts were forgotten, the sodden
forest, the rain, the indifferent food, and the
poor sport, but the impressive scenery of the
vast Vancouver forest, the still lakes and
rushing creeks, and the beauty of the Kingcome
inlet, with its setting of snow-covered mountains,
will remain indelibly impressed on my
memory, and as the prospect of future trips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
becomes more remote, the recollections of those
days will always be with me. The call of the
wild may be as strong as ever, but the capacity
to respond to it must diminish as years roll on.
The man who has not a love for the solitudes
of nature and the simple life in camp, misses
experiences which to me at least have been
amongst the keenest enjoyments of my life.</p>

<p>September 27th. We arrived at Vancouver
about 5 p.m. That day I saw Mr. Williams,
just returned from inspection and sport in the
Kootenay district. He reported game plentiful
and brought back two fine sheep heads which
he had secured after hard work and stiff
climbing.</p>

<p>I left Vancouver on the 29th and, changing
trains at Winnipeg, arrived at Toronto on
October 3rd&mdash;four hours late from Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Leaving Toronto the next morning, I spent
that evening and the following day at Niagara
Falls, arriving in New York in the early morning
of the 6th. Through the kindness of Mr.
Griswold, I had been made an honorary member
of the Knickerbocker and Union Clubs. More
luxurious and better-managed clubs could not
be found in any capital of Europe.</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. I was once more steaming out
of New York on the <i>Blücher</i>, one of the slower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
steamers of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and
after a most comfortable voyage, with charming
fellow-passengers, I disembarked at Southampton
on the 17th&mdash;just three months and seven
days from leaving England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

TO NEWFOUNDLAND</h2>


<p>Notwithstanding my resolve that the Vancouver
trip should be my last one, the call of
the wild was once more too strong, and the summer
of 1910 found me planning an expedition
to Newfoundland.</p>

<p>I think J. G. Millais' charming book <i>Newfoundland
and its Untrodden Ways</i>, as well
as the description he personally gave me of
the country, were largely responsible for my
decision.</p>

<p>I sailed from Southampton on August 5th
by the <i>Cincinnati</i>, of the Hamburg-Amerika
Line, bound for St. John's, Newfoundland, via
New York.</p>

<p>The ship was crowded and the voyage as
monotonous as all Atlantic voyages are, while
being a slow boat we only arrived at New
York on the morning of the 14th. The heat
of New York was intense, and I was not sorry
to leave it at midnight for Boston, and straight
on via St. John's, New Brunswick, to Sydney,
where I took the <i>Bruce</i>, which runs between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Sydney and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland,
a distance of a hundred miles.</p>

<p>I would recommend any one who is taking
this route, and is not a total abstainer, to provide
himself with a bottle of whisky, for Maine,
through which a good portion of the journey
lies, is a teetotal state, and even on board the
<i>Bruce</i> not a drop of any form of liquor, even
beer, was allowed to be served until the steamer
was under way.</p>

<p>Getting away at eleven o'clock, and after a
rather rough passage, for the <i>Bruce</i> is only
about 800 tons, we arrived at Port aux Basques
at 7 a.m. on the 17th.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning, and the rocky shores
of Newfoundland looked particularly wild and
attractive in the bright sunshine. Port aux
Basques is a small settlement, and so far as I
could ascertain does not contain an hotel, but
no doubt some form of lodging-house exists,
where, as throughout the island, the visitor
would be given a warm welcome and whatever
was going, be it little or much.</p>

<p>The train was waiting for the steamer. The
line is a narrow-gauge one, but the cars were
quite comfortable, and the prospect of seeing
a new country is always attractive. But how
we did bump over that line; whether it was the
fault of the laying of the permanent way or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
driving I cannot say, but in a long experience
of railway travelling I never have been so jolted,
the driver seeming to take a special pleasure
in pulling up with a jerk sufficient to knock
over any one standing up, and then to start, if
possible, in a rougher manner. However, no
one seemed to mind, and after all passengers
should be grateful for having a line at all.
My mouth watered at accounts I heard of sea
trout fishing, about three hours by launch from
Port aux Basques. I was told that a few days
previously three rods got 110 sea trout, averaging
three pounds, in the Garia River, in a few
hours.</p>

<p>Getting away at 8.15 we passed all along the
west coast, through a most beautiful country,
teeming with salmon rivers, most of them I fear
much over-fished, for the west coast rivers are
the favourite haunts of the American angler,
being easily reached from New York and
Boston.</p>

<p>Thompson's Hotel, prettily situated on the
Little Codroy River, looked particularly attractive,
and two American anglers got off there.
I was told there was a late run of big fish in
August, an exception, for as a rule all the
Newfoundland rivers are early ones.</p>

<p>At Crabbes a local guide, on the look-out
for a job, deeply deplored the fact that Crabbes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
should be neglected for the better-known Little
and Big Codroy Rivers. He assured me there
were two rivers, the one ten minutes, the other
about two minutes, from the station, "crawling"
of course with fish, and that a thirty-five
pound salmon had been caught by a local
angler a few days before. No doubt he was crying
up his own wares. There was neither hotel
nor boarding-house at Crabbes&mdash;camping out
was necessary, but the country is a lovely one,
and what could be more enjoyable than a
comfortable camp on the banks of the river
if only the fish were there and the water in
fishing trim. Black flies and mosquitoes must
not, however, be lightly put aside, for they are
the curse of the island in the summer months.</p>

<p>As we slowly bumped our way north, the
scenery became more and more beautiful, until
it culminated in the views as the train skirted
the Humber River, then along Deer Lake,
gradually rising towards the barrens of the
centre of the island. All along the sides of the
railway the ground was carpeted with wild
flowers, a perfect blaze of colour. Nightfall
found us at the north end of the Grand Lake,
where is situated "The Bungalow," a sporting
hotel recently established, which from the train
looked most comfortable.</p>

<p>The food in the dining-car was quite good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
but by no means cheap. Why one should pay
40 cents, about 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, for a slice of fried cod
in the very home of the cod, when a whole fish
can be purchased for half the money, I could
not understand, and although Newfoundland
abounds in fish neither trout nor salmon were
once served in the restaurant car.</p>

<p>On Thursday the 18th I arrived at St. John's
at 12.30, having travelled without a stop from
the previous Sunday at midnight. It is much
to be regretted that the direct Allan Line from
Liverpool to St. John's, which only takes seven
days, should not have larger and more up-to-date
steamers. The largest boat is under 5,000
tons; not very comfortable for crossing the
Atlantic. As the Allan Line run excellent
boats to Quebec, there must be some good
reason for the local service to St. John's not
being better served.</p>

<p>Leaving England on August 5th, and travelling
continuously, I did not reach St. John's
till the 18th. It is true I took a slow boat and
came by New York. A better route would
have been by one of the larger steamers to
Quebec or Rimouski, and then back by rail to
Sydney, and so on to Port aux Basques.</p>

<p>If the large steamers which pass so close to
Newfoundland would only make a call at St.
John's, to disembark passengers, I feel sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
many more tourists would be tempted to visit
the island.</p>

<p>I was met at the station by Mr. Blair, Jr.,
whose firm were to provide all my outfit except
camp equipment, which I had sent ahead from
England. I was much indebted to him for
valuable information and advice.</p>

<p>I was, I must confess, very disappointed with
St. John's, which is not worthy to be the
capital of England's oldest colony, and the less
said about hotel accommodation the better.
The best hotel was really only an indifferent
boarding-house, and could not compare in
comfort with the hotel of any small provincial
town at home.</p>

<p>St. John's possessing few attractions for me,
I decided to get away as soon as possible.
When I left England the steamer <i>Glencoe</i>,
which sails from Placentia to Port aux Basques,
all along the south coast, was timed to leave
every Saturday, but the sailing had been
altered to Wednesday, leaving me with some
idle days, which I could not face in St.
John's.</p>

<p>I had heard of sea trout fishing and possible
salmon in the south-east arm of Placentia,
where good accommodation was to be had at
a fishing inn, known as Fulford's. Wiring to
Mr. Fulford to know if the sea trout were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
running, the answer came back that they were
all in the ponds, which I did not quite understand
at the time, but anything was better than
five days in St. John's, so on Saturday, August
20th, I started by the morning train for
Placentia and Fulford's.</p>

<p>The rain came down in torrents as we left
St. John's at 8.45 a.m. and lasted till we arrived
at Placentia at 1.45&mdash;eighty miles in five hours.
These Newfoundland trains are certainly not
flyers.</p>

<p>Placentia is very beautifully situated at the
junction of the two arms of the sea, known as
the south-east and the north-east arms. The
main town is on a spit of land which extends
out into the sea, making the one entrance to
either arm a very narrow channel, and through
this the full force of the tide races, causing
whirlpools and eddies which looked anything
but safe. The foreshore was composed of large
round stones, not pebbles, and the roar of these
as they washed up and down the beach by the
waves is one of the characteristics of Placentia.
They say the people of Placentia talk louder
than any one else in the island on account of
this.</p>

<p>I was met at the station by George Kelly
from Fulford's, who told me he had a buggy
waiting for me across the ferry; but food was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
first necessary, and I got a mess of meat at
the local hotel for 35 cents. On asking for
a glass of beer or a whisky-and-soda, I was told
they only kept "sober drinks," an expression
which I heard for the first time.</p>

<p>The traveller in Newfoundland must reconcile
himself to teetotalism and tea, unless he
can carry his own liquor along. Even at the
hotel in St. John's only very indifferent beer
was obtainable with meals; for anything else
one had to go round the corner to a second-rate
public-house. Now all this seems very unnecessary,
for it would appear to me that there
is much greater chance of a man getting drunk
if he finds himself set down in a public-house
after dinner than if he could obtain what he
reasonably required in his hotel. But all Newfoundland
drinks tea, and the sensible traveller
will adapt himself to the local customs, as well
as to the midday dinner and the light early
tea or supper.</p>

<p>The ferry was only a couple of hundred yards
across, and George and I were soon on our way
to Fulford's.</p>

<p>The drive was a lovely one, the road winding
high up over the south-east arm. The weather
had cleared up, the sun was shining brightly,
the hills were glistening in the sunshine after
the heavy rain, and every little stream had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
become a roaring torrent, which George said
promised well for the fishing.</p>

<p>After a five-mile drive we arrived at Fulford's
and I was warmly welcomed by Mr. Fulford
and his wife, really charming people. The
house was scrupulously clean. Fortunately
for me, I was the only guest, and I can only say
Mrs. Fulford gave me the best food I had in
Newfoundland, while her terms were even more
than moderate. The situation of the house
was very beautiful, overlooking the mouth of
the river, which was about a mile away.</p>

<p>I naturally inquired first about the fishing.</p>

<p>It seemed I was too late for the sea trout in
the river itself, at least in its lower reaches.
The sea trout run about July 14th, in great
numbers, but only for a short time. The
salmon run earlier.</p>

<p>In the season Fulford's is crammed, anglers
sleeping anywhere all over the house, and
struggling with each other for the best water.</p>

<p>The river, after a run of about four miles,
falls out of what are locally termed ponds&mdash;what
we would call lochs&mdash;and at this season of the
year all the fish were in these lochs. At
certain distances they are connected one with
the other by short runs of a few yards, and here
the fish lie. These are known as the four-mile,
five-mile, six-mile and seven-mile pools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Starting off about 4 o'clock, I drove up to
the four-mile pool. The road was fairly good,
winding along above the river through the wood,
and the drive was most enjoyable. As we
gradually ascended, the view, looking back over
the south-east arm, was very beautiful, reminding
me very much of Scotch scenery in Sutherland.</p>

<p>The entire country was saturated from the
morning rain, and we started in our waders,
as George said we had swampy ground to pass
through before reaching the pool. Hitching
up the horse where a pathway branched off, we
plunged through a very wet swamp for a few
hundred yards down to the pool.</p>

<p>The water was pouring down from the upper
loch, the pool was full of fish all on the move
for the run up to the higher waters, the evening
was closing in&mdash;the black flies and mosquitoes
were troublesome. Though I cast over many
fish I never got a rise. Getting home at dusk
I found an excellent dinner of roast fowl and
wild raspberries and cream awaiting me.</p>

<p>The next morning we started early for the
seven-mile pool. The going was pretty rough
but the scenery very beautiful. We gradually
emerged from the woods on to the higher and
more open ground. A half-mile walk through
a very wet marsh brought us to the bank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
stream between the two lochs, which was in
perfect order. It was only a few yards wide
and I could cover the entire fishable water with
my fourteen-foot Castleconnell rod. I rose
several fish, killed three who gave good sport,
and lost a fly in another. As the water was
about fished out we went down to the six-mile
pool, where I killed one and lost another, but
the fish were all small, 5&frac12;, 4&frac12;, 4, 3&frac12; lb.</p>

<p>The following day we again tried the seven-mile
pool, but the water had run down and
there was little or no stream between the two
lochs. I got one fish of 4 lb., and never saw
another. As there was little chance of more
salmon I asked my host if there were any trout
in the neighbourhood. He strongly advised
me trying a loch nine miles up the road, where
he and a friend had got twenty-seven dozen
mud trout (? char) in one day's fishing the
previous year. After a rough drive over a
very bad road for the last three miles we found
the loch, but it was so overgrown with water-lilies
that there was not a square yard of water
on which to cast a fly. Whether they had
grown up since his visit and whether they died
down later on in the season I cannot say, but
we had wasted our day. I could not understand
the river; thousands of sea trout run up
but I never saw or rose one. It was hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
a river, but a series of lochs with connecting
streams. There were no boats on the lochs,
but I had hoped to find sea trout in the tail of
the streams. Not one, however, did I even
see rise. There are a number of lochs about
nine miles up. Whether they contained fish
or not I cannot say. I think it would well
repay Mr. Fulford, who is the fish warden of
the district, to investigate the habits of the
sea trout and find out where they eventually
lie, presumably in the upper lochs, and put
boats on. The salmon I got were in good condition
and excellent eating. Driving home in
the evening about sunset, we generally saw
quite a number of Nova Scotia hares, locally
called rabbits, sitting out on the road. I saw
no other game of any description, though there
are plenty of partridges (ruffled grouse) in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The steamer was due to sail from Placentia
on the 24th inst., at 3 p.m., so I left Fulford's
with much regret at 10.30 a.m. and drove into
Placentia, where I found she would not sail
till midnight owing to the amount of cargo.</p>

<p>Going into the Post Office to inquire for
letters, I was told I must see the Communion
Plate of the Protestant Church, which was kept
in the Post Office. It was a very handsome
service of plate presented by Prince William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Henry, who as a young naval officer passed a
winter in Placentia, then I believe the capital
of the island. It was weary work getting
through the day till the steamer sailed. Every
berth was taken, so I had a shakedown in the
corridor, which was much more airy than any
cabin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

TO LONG HARBOUR</h2>


<p>In planning my trip I had the benefit of
J. G. Millais' advice. He first recommended
me to try the country at the head of the La
Poile River on the south coast near Port aux
Basques. On inquiry I found out that canoes
could not be used. Everything would have
to be packed, and it would take six men to pack
to the hunting grounds. With the memory
of my Vancouver trip before me, I decided
against the La Poile country and packing, and
chose the ground Millais had hunted with such
success in 1906. He had gone in by the Long
Harbour River, struck off to the north-west
to Kesoquit and Shoe Hill Ridge and the Mount
Sylvester region. But the Long Harbour
River was very rough, and his canoes being at
Hungry Grove Pond, where a series of ponds
led up to Sandy Pond or Jubilee Lake, its more
modern name, I finally decided on this route,
which would bring me quite close to Shoe Hill
Ridge and Mount Sylvester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Millais himself had not travelled over this
ground, so the map published in his book only
gave an approximate idea of the country and
its waterways. I had secured the services of
Steve Bernard, Millais' head man, and he was
to meet me with two other Indians at the head
of Long Harbour when I would send a wire.</p>

<p>My route was to be Placentia to Belleoram
by the <i>Glencoe</i>. At Belleoram Mr. Ryan, who
is in charge of the telegraph station at the head
of Long Harbour, was to meet me in his sailing
schooner the <i>Caribou</i>, and from Long Harbour
we were to pack in to Hungry Grove Pond,
where the canoes were to be ready.</p>

<p>We did not get away from Placentia till
1 a.m., and crossing Placentia Bay arrived at
Burin the following morning in a thick fog,
which occasionally lifted, showing a fine, wild
coast with rocky headlands on all sides. Burin
was a pretty spot, and I saw it better on my
return when there was no fog. We arrived at
Grand Bank, a big fishing town, in the evening,
but the fog outside was so thick that the
Captain decided to anchor till 2 a.m. and then
cross Fortune Bay to Belleoram.</p>

<p>Grand Bank was responsible for the change
in the sailing date of the <i>Glencoe</i>. Leaving
Placentia on Saturday she was due at Grand
Bank on Sunday. The inhabitants being very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
religious objected to loading and unloading on
Sunday, so the sailing was changed to Wednesday,
and their consciences were satisfied.
They forgot, however, that they made some
smaller port of call further west break the
Sabbath, but being one of the most important
shipping centres in the cod season their views
had to be met.</p>

<p>We arrived at Belleoram at 6 a.m. on the
26th, feeling our way along the coast with our
foghorn.</p>

<p>I and my belongings were turned out on the
pier and I felt my trip had at last begun.</p>

<p>The <i>Caribou</i> was in harbour and a boat put
off with Steve Bernard, who had come down to
meet me and help Mr. Ryan, who was laid up
on board with a bad leg. I at once went out
to call on Mr. Ryan, as I wanted to get away as
soon as possible. I found a sturdy Irishman
of about sixty, full of go and energy, and in the
cheeriest spirits, only extremely annoyed at
the bad leg, which made him pretend to lie up,
for lie up he never did, his restless nature
would not allow it, and he was always on the
move.</p>

<p>His illness began with a boil, but he <i>would</i>
go off into the woods after caribou and so
irritated it, that the boil had developed into a
large sloughing ulcer with considerable inflammation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
He did not seem to mind it much and
insisted on hobbling about the deck.</p>

<p>There was only one place at which I was recommended
to put up in case I had to stay in Belleoram,
so I went up to call on Mrs. Cluett and
incidentally forage for breakfast. I received a
courteous welcome and had plenty of eggs, bread
and butter, and tea. Getting back to the <i>Caribou</i>
I persuaded Ryan to make a start. There was
a thick fog and it was blowing hard; however,
away we went in grand style, steering for the
different points which loomed through the fog.
As soon as we got into the open and had to
cross some twelve or fourteen miles of open sea,
an ancient and dilapidated compass was produced
from the confusion of below, for the
<i>Caribou</i> was not altogether a tidy boat; the
compass gave a certain moral support, but the
needle refused to point in any direction steadily
for more than five minutes. Ryan would give
it a smack, "Sure I think she's only about five
points out now," and in a few minutes, "She's
gone all wrong again."</p>

<p>I was entrusted with the steering, which may
account for our sighting land about four miles
north of the entrance to Long Harbour. It
was a pretty rough crossing, but the old <i>Caribou</i>
was a seaworthy and dry boat. The weather
was what one expects of Newfoundland, wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and foggy, and the mountains looming up out
of the fog looked bigger and grander than they
really were.</p>

<p>We had a rattling following breeze, and notwithstanding
Ryan's assertion that there would
be no fog at his house, we ran up the fourteen
miles of Long Harbour and arrived there about
4 o'clock in the afternoon in a dense fog,
having left Belleoram at 10 a.m. Here I
found waiting my two other Indians, John
Denny Jeddore and Steve Joe. My party consisted
then of Steve Bernard, head man and
hunter, John Denny Jeddore, generally known
as John Denny, and Steve Joe, who had to
become Joe.</p>

<p>John Denny at once told me he had signed
on as cook, but added quaintly: "I have never
cooked for gentles." All the same he was an
excellent plain cook, ready to learn anything,
scrupulously clean in all his cooking, and a first-rate
fellow. Joe was general utility man and
always cheery. Steve Bernard was a pure
bred Micmac, his father having been chief of
the Micmac tribe, and the other two were half-breeds.
John Denny's mother was a Frenchwoman,
which perhaps accounted for his extraordinarily
nice manners. My men were somewhat
shy and reserved at first, but we soon
became great friends, and I can only say I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
never wish for better men or comrades on a
hunting expedition. We never had a word of
difference. They were always bright and willing,
and under the most uncomfortable circumstances
never uttered a word of complaint.
I think I may say we parted with mutual
regret. They all spoke English, but Steve
Bernard was the most fluent. Amongst themselves
they chattered in their own soft Micmac
language, and they never seemed to stop talking.
All Newfoundlanders have a specially
charming accent, which is neither Irish nor
Canadian, and certainly not American. It is
very soft and mellifluous. "All right," pronounced
as if it were "aal," is the most common
expression, and seems to be used on every
possible occasion.</p>

<p>All my men, instead of dropping their "h's"
in the Cockney fashion, seemed to aspirate
almost every word beginning with a vowel,
for instance they always spoke of h'oil, h'oar,
h'eat, and h'arm, and so with many other words.</p>

<p>The Micmacs are Catholics, and their headquarters
in Canada are at Restigouche. Their
settlement in Newfoundland is on the Conne
River. A priest from Restigouche visits Conne
River from time to time and preaches in Micmac.
At Restigouche are published the Bible,
Catechism and other books in Micmac, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
has the same character as English but only
sixteen letters. A Micmac paper is also
published at Restigouche and received once
a month at Conne River. Steve was very
amusing over the raising of funds for the
construction of a new church at Conne River.
Apparently a sort of bazaar was held at which
the chief feature was a "Wheel of Fortune."
Steve felt rather sore that he had gambled
fifteen dollars and won nothing. All the
Micmac colony, however, seemed to have
enjoyed themselves hugely, gambling, dancing,
and eating; they provided the food and afterwards
paid for each meal&mdash;good for the church!</p>

<p>Ryan's niece kept house for him at Long
Harbour&mdash;a lonely spot with only one other
settler within twelve miles, and I received from
uncle and niece the warm welcome which every
traveller in Newfoundland is sure to meet with.
The morning of the 27th was exquisite, the
fog had cleared away, the sun was shining
brightly, and the placid head-waters of Long
Harbour lay without a ripple at our feet. The
hills were not high but beautiful in colour and
outline, and I might easily have imagined
myself in a Scotch deer forest. Cases of stores
had to be unpacked, tent and camp equipment
looked out, and the morning was spent in
making up the loads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>I had brought an 11-feet square fly for the
three men, two tents for myself, both of the
lean-to pattern, one heavier and stronger tent
of green canvas 7 feet × 7 feet, the other the
6 feet × 7 feet silk tent I had used in Vancouver,
and which weighed only 5 lb, my idea being to
use it for short trips from the main camp. One
pair of Hudson Bay blankets made into a sleeping
bag, a pillow, the usual cooking tins in nests,
and the folding baker completed my outfit.
This latter is simply invaluable; I purchased
one locally in St. John's.</p>

<p>Camp furniture I had none, but as experience
had taught me that the comfort of a bed of
balsam on the ground was somewhat overrated,
I had brought a sheet of strong canvas 7 feet ×
2 feet 9 inches, with gussets on either side, and
eyelet holes at the top and bottom. Into the
gussets were slipped strong poles and these laid
on two logs at the head and foot in which
notches were cut to receive them, and then the
poles were nailed down with one 3-inch nail at
each end, and the canvas at the head and foot
laced round the logs.</p>

<p>A more comfortable camp bed it was impossible
to have and it took about ten minutes
to construct. With men such as I had,
skilful with their axes, to bring camp furniture
was unnecessary: tables, benches, poles for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
hanging clothes, rifle and gun rests, can
easily be made, and one day in a permanent
camp is sufficient to have all a hunter can
want. My men were as good as, if not better
than the French Canadians I employed when
hunting moose in Canada some nine years
before. They introduced me to a bench or
camp seat I had never seen before. A suitable
tree with outstanding branches is cut down,
a short section chosen, on which, on one side
at least, there are four branches to form the legs;
this is split in two and an excellent camp stool
is the result.</p>

<p>I found we had eight loads, which meant
double journeys as far as Hungry Grove Pond,
so I started off Joe and John Denny with two
packs, while Steve and I took a light camp up
to Mitchell's Point, where the river ran into the
head of the Long Harbour and from which I
was assured I could get some good sea trout
fishing. We had camp pitched and our midday
meal over by 3 o'clock, so started up the
river for the sea trout on which we depended
for dinner. It was a rough journey along
the river bank or in its bed, and although all
the water looked tempting it was 5 o'clock
before we reached the pool in which the fish
were supposed to be.</p>

<p>Long Harbour River is one of the biggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
rivers in the south and in the early summer a
large number of salmon and sea trout run up,
but like most Newfoundland rivers that I saw,
the pools alternated with long shallow runs,
where no fish would lie. There were certainly
some beautiful pools, so it was a disappointment,
more especially as regards dinner, that I only
rose one fish and hooked another which broke
away. Steve unfortunately cut his foot with
the small axe in making camp. It looked
nothing, but on his way up the river the wound
opened and bled rather freely. I fixed him
up with a pad and a bandage, and dressed it
on our return to camp with 1/1000 corrosive
sublimate solution made from tabloids, without
which I never travel.</p>

<p>We had only about half-an-hour to fish if we
would get back to camp, some four miles away,
before dark, so we really did not give the water
a fair chance. We did not get into camp till
about 8.30. Steve declared he was first-rate
at slapjacks, so while I prepared a square of
Lazenby's soup he set to work on the slapjacks.
After using half a tin of butter he produced a
sodden mass of dough, on which and the soup
we made a poor meal.</p>

<p>The flies and mosquitoes were very troublesome,
but Farlow's "dope" was fairly successful.</p>

<p>Our camping ground was too near the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and on rather low ground. A very heavy dew
fell during the night and everything was soaking
in the morning. As the fishing was not
likely to prove a success we decided to return
to Ryan's and push on after our men. Getting
away about 12 o'clock, for I had sent Steve
back to Ryan's on foot to borrow their dory
which brought our camp up, we stopped to
boil the kettle and have lunch near a settler's
place just beyond the mouth of the river. He
was a hardy old man, by name Joe Riggs,
and though he had recently undergone several
operations in the hospital at St. John's to
remove some diseased ribs, he was working
away all alone getting in his hay. He was very
lonely and sad for he had only recently lost his
wife, and the way he spoke about her was very
touching. In winter, however, he went down
to Anderson's Cove, a small settlement at the
mouth of Long Harbour, where a married
daughter lived. Among the solitary settlers
I met, of whom Joe Riggs was a type, it was
remarkable how the spot they had selected for
settling on was the very finest to be found, and
to poor old Joe, Long Harbour was a sort of
earthly Paradise which he would not exchange
for any other part of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>On reaching Ryan's, where I was ashamed
to trespass once more on his hospitality for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
night, I found John Denny and Joe had taken
two packs on about eleven miles, to a spot about
three miles from Hungry Grove Pond and
returned for more loads.</p>

<p>I took another Indian, Micky John by name,
to help and the three men started off about
3 o'clock. Two were to return the next day,
while John Denny was to make a double trip
down to Hungry Grove Pond.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

TO THE HUNTING GROUNDS</h2>


<p>The following day, the 29th, I had to wait
for the men to come back, so did not start till
10.30. The track led up the steep hill behind
Ryan's house. It was rough going, but nothing
in daylight, and the air that morning made
one feel glad to be alive. After a steady rise
of about two miles we came on to a great wild
plateau with hardly a tree to be seen, and I
had my first experience of the great barrens of
Newfoundland. The colouring was exquisite,
and though desolate in the extreme the scenery
had a great charm of its own, chiefly due to
effects of light and shade.</p>

<p>Deep shadows thrown by the fleecy clouds
overhead fell on ridges far away and gave an
idea of immensity and distance without which
the view might have been monotonous. The
air was extraordinarily clear: a ridge which
looked a couple of miles away was pointed out
to me as six-mile ridge, the head of the divide,
from which the ground sloped away to our
destination, Hungry Grove Pond. It took us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
till 3 o'clock to reach the top of the ridge,
which at first sight looked so near. The rise
the whole way was very gradual, in fact hardly
perceptible. The whole country was undulating,
low ridges alternating with little valleys,
and in each bottom was a small pond from
which issued a noisy stream. Dwarf balsam
was scattered in patches. A bright yellow
grass showed where the marshes, locally called
"mishes," which we had to cross, lay, and
though there had been a spell of dry weather,
very wet and boggy some of these "mishes"
were.</p>

<p>When we reached the six-mile ridge we caught
our first glimpse of the top of Mount Sylvester,
just showing a pale blue on the sky-line, while
far down below in a valley lay Hungry Grove
Pond.</p>

<p>I calculated we had come eight miles, for
the six-mile ridge had been measured from the
old Telegraph Office instead of the new.</p>

<p>Dark clouds were now coming up from the
coast, and it looked as if we were in for a bad
night. I asked Steve if he were certain he had
brought the pack with my blankets and waterproof
sheet. On examining the packs we found
that this, the most important to me at least,
had been left behind. Here was a pleasant
position. Heavy rain coming up with a cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
driving wind and no bedding for the night.
But Steve was equal to the occasion and showed
me what a first-rate man he was. Our camp
was three miles ahead, Ryan's house eight
miles behind, and it was 3 o'clock in the
afternoon. Steve quietly said, "My fault,
I go back and fetch up the pack." None of
the others offered to go in his place, so laying
down his own pack, for which I was to send
back from camp, away went Steve at a trot.</p>

<p>We pushed on to camp, which John had
pitched in a small droke, and just as we got in,
down came the rain in torrents.</p>

<p>Getting a tent pitched in heavy rain is poor
fun, but camp was soon comfortable and a
roaring fire going. I had shot three grouse
with my little rook rifle on the march, out of
season I may say, but when it is a question of
food I fear game laws are apt to be disregarded
in the wilds. I soon had a good stew of grouse,
potatoes and onions cooking, which was pronounced
excellent later on. John was shy of
showing his own abilities as a chef and sat
humbly at my feet as a learner. After dinner
we were talking of poor Steve's bad luck and
how wet and uncomfortable he must be, and
discussing when we should send one of the men
back with a lantern to meet him. It was then
quite dark, about 7.30 p.m., when Steve walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
quietly into the camp with his pack and simply
remarked: "Don't think I made bad time."
I should think not. He had covered nineteen
miles, eleven of them carrying a pack, in four
and a half hours&mdash;a fine performance. He well
deserved the tot of rum which I served out to
him. I heard afterwards that in June he had
left Ryan's house at 4 a.m. with a light pack
and arrived at Conne River, his home, a distance
of forty-eight miles, at 8 o'clock the
same evening.</p>

<p>I had gathered from Millais' book that Steve
was rather addicted to rum, which was confirmed
by a letter from him to Mr. Blair, saying,
"Don't forget some rum, for you know how
fond I am of it." I rather chaffed him about
this letter and he assured me that it was a
mistake&mdash;he could not write himself and some
girl in his settlement had written for him and
put the passage in without his knowledge. I
can only say that I had no difficulty with Steve
or any of the others over the question of liquor.
I kept the whisky and rum locked up in a box,
but I think I might have left it open. I had
only six bottles of whisky and three of rum,
and on opening the box one of the latter was
found broken. I spread this amount over our
entire trip till I got back to St. John's. John
told me he did not care for rum. Joe acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
he liked it, but Steve more than once
refused a tot, even after a hard day.</p>

<p>It was a cold camp that night, the ground
was saturated, the balsam bedding dripping,
and the cold and damp struck up through the
thick waterproof sheet and two blankets.</p>

<p>The following morning was perfect, a bright
sun shining and a cold nip in the air.</p>

<p>John had packed two loads down to the Pond
the previous day, so we started together carrying
four loads. Track down to the Pond there
was none, and the ground after last night's
rain was soaking. The swamps were full of
water and the going very hard, but we had
only three miles to cover. On the way I
stalked a lot of geese, but only got a shot with
the rook rifle at about 150 yards and the bullet
fell short. Once at the lake all troubles were
over and I had to look forward to a comfortable
trip in the two Peterborough canoes lying
ready. Micky John was sent home. We had
seen a doe caribou on the way and he announced
his intention of having a try for
venison. Joe was sent back to Ryan's for the
last light load, and Steve and John to bring up
the two remaining loads from last night's camp.
I pitched my tent and made things generally
shipshape till the men came back. The camp
was an ideal one, situated on a wooded spit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
land which separated the main pond from the
smaller arm. The ground was sandy and dry,
firewood abundant, and a brilliant sun was
shining over the glassy lake, the shores of
which were densely wooded. Packing was
done with for the time, two canoes, which
enabled us to travel in comfort, were lying
pulled up on the sandy beach, and the caribou
grounds were a couple of days ahead. What
more could a hunter's heart desire. No more
letters would be received, no news from the
outside world for at least a month, only the
joy of solitude in communion with nature, a
joy which once experienced can never be forgotten.
In the rush and turmoil of life which
was to come, when my holiday was over, I
could at least have the memories of the happy
time now before me to look back on.</p>

<p>The men all turned up in good time in the
afternoon, so I tried the lake and got three
trout about half-a-pound each on the minnow.
After an excellent dinner we were soon sleeping
the sleep of the just, with roaring fires in front
of my tent and the men's fly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

HUNGRY GROVE POND TO SANDY POND</h2>


<p>The morning of the 31st was bright and cold,
though rain had fallen in the night, and we got
away about 9 o'clock. One hour's steady
paddling and rowing, for the larger canoe had
oars, took us to the north end of Hungry Grove
Pond, about three miles I should say, from
which issued a brook communicating with Red
Hill Pond. The water was very low and the
men spent most of their time in the water
dragging the canoes over the rocky shallows.
I strolled along the bank and saw many old
tracks of caribou, but nothing fresh. We had
one portage of about half-a-mile, to pass some
bad rapids. The brook was about two miles
long and owing to the bad water and portage
it took us some two hours to get down to Red
Hill Pond. We named the brook the Two
Mile Brook. Millais had shown a communication
between Hungry Grove Pond and Red
Hill Pond in his map of the district, but never
having travelled over the line we were taking
he could not show details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Red Hill Pond takes its name from a rocky
reddish bluff, which rises a couple of hundred
feet on the east side of the pond. The country
is said to be a good one for bear, but we did
not even see fresh tracks.</p>

<p>The pond is only about a mile long, and we
got to the end about lunch-time.</p>

<p>I had brought rod rings with me, and had
rigged up a rough trolling rod at our first camp,
to which I lashed a spare reel. I made it a
rule to have this primitive rod and my twelve-foot
trout rod trolling over every lake and pond
we crossed. I generally put a Devon minnow
on one rod, and a blue phantom on the other.
I used the fly exclusively when we came to
any streams. I got one trout, a lively fish of
1&frac12; lb., in crossing Red Hill Pond and two in
Hungry Grove Pond. There was a rapid and
a nice pool at the north end of the pond where
we halted for lunch, and putting on a small
silver doctor in a few minutes I had six nice
trout, some of 1&frac12; lb., ready for lunch. John
Denny said they were all onannaniche or landlocked
salmon. I had never seen them before;
they were just like sea trout, and played in
the same way, jumping out of the water even
more frequently than sea trout. They were
strong, game fish, and better still, excellent
eating. Here I got my first mud trout, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
I take to be char. They were more flabby
and not in such good condition as the onannaniche;
their flesh was a bright red, and they
were good eating.</p>

<p>From Red Hill Pond, after a portage over
the short rapid where I had fished, we entered
a long weedy pond where fishing was impossible;
then came shallow streams with just
a perceptible current and three more large
ponds, till we reached our camping ground at
4.30 at the head of a rough brook, over which
we had to portage next day. I calculated we
had come about fourteen miles. The steadies
required careful navigation, for there were
masses of sharp rocks, some just submerged,
others showing well above the water. The
bow paddler had to keep a sharp look-out, for
very little will knock a hole in a Peterborough
canoe. We were now getting rather anxious
for meat, for it is simply impossible to carry
tinned provisions in sufficient quantity to
satisfy the appetites of four hungry men.</p>

<p>The wind had been north-east all day, and
fell to a dead calm as Steve and I quietly
paddled out, skirting the lake shore, with the
hope of seeing game. We went about a mile
and landed on a sandy beach where there were
one or two fresh tracks, and then on about half-a-mile
inland to a rocky knoll from which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
could spy the surrounding country, which was
mostly marsh with patches of dense wood
scattered all over the plain and becoming
thicker down by the lake's edge.</p>

<p>At this season of the year all the stags spend
their days in the woods, and only come out
morning and evening to feed. There was not
a breath of air and the mosquitoes and black
fly were out in force; towards sunset we saw
a small stag with a poor head come out of a
wood about a mile away, and feed down towards
us. We had visions of caribou steak
and liver and bacon before us, when suddenly
the wind veered right round; at the same time
a fox on the shore of the lake, who had seen us,
kept barking persistently. Whether it was
the wind or the fox I can't say, but the stag
put up his head, turned right round and walked
straight away&mdash;alas, the hopes of meat were
gone. It was getting dusk, so we made for the
canoe. On the way we saw a very small doe,
but the wind was again wrong and she was off
in a moment. We got back to camp in the
dark.</p>

<p>Steve swore we must have meat and asked
for my Rigby Mauser that he might go out
at daybreak and shoot anything eatable. I
offered him the little rook rifle, so it was
decided he would be out before daybreak for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
meat. I was only hunting heads, but all the
Indians had strong opinions on the subject of
meat.</p>

<p>On September 1st Steve was out at daybreak
with the small rifle and came back about
seven o'clock triumphant, having shot a young
stag in good condition. He had crawled within
about fifty yards and killed the beast with one
shot. I was simply astonished, for I never could
have believed that the little rifle, one of Rigby's
rook rifles, could have killed an animal bigger
than an ordinary red deer. Steve had brought
in the liver and kidneys and left the meat to be
picked up on our march, for fortunately it was
close to a pond we had to pass through. How
we all revelled in a good breakfast of kidneys
and liver and bacon. Every one was in good
humour, for we now had ample meat.</p>

<p>The brook was about three-quarters of a mile
long and everything had to be portaged.</p>

<p>It looked ideal fishing water, and while the
men were portaging I fished every pool. I got
two onannaniche and two mud trout above the
first pool, and then never a rise, though the
pools looked perfect.</p>

<p>Where the brook fell into the next lake
looked the best water, but I could move nothing.
Why, I could not understand, unless it was that
the season was late for these waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>When the portage was over Steve and John
went across the pond for the meat, and Joe and
I pushed on in the big canoe about a mile across
the pond to another rapid, fortunately only
about thirty yards long, where we again had to
portage. The day had turned bitterly cold and
heavy rain clouds were coming up. I had got
very warm walking and fishing along the brook,
and though I put on a thick jersey the wind
seemed to cut like a knife and I got a bad cold
which gave me some trouble for days after.
Poor old Joe had spent most of the day up to his
waist in water getting the empty canoes down
the creek and was looking very miserable.
The men wore nothing but their cotton shirts
and coats, cotton trousers and moccasins&mdash;they
were never dry, but never seemed to catch
cold.</p>

<p>It was just the occasion for a tot of rum.
Whether it went to Joe's head or not I cannot
say&mdash;he certainly became extra cheerful, and
when the other men returned and all the men
were carrying the loads across the rapid, Joe
tumbled twice right into the water and got a
thorough ducking. I only made a gesture of
taking a tot, when I thought these simple folk
would never stop laughing. It was a joke
which lasted them the rest of the trip, and in
Indian circles no doubt I have the reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of being a great wit. Joe laughed if possible
more heartily than the others, and though
soaked to the skin was quite happy for the rest
of the day.</p>

<p>Just as we were loading up the canoes John
pointed to the sky-line about half-a-mile away
and quietly said, "That good stag, I think."
Sure enough there was a heavy beast, the first
big stag I had seen, quietly feeding along the
crest of the ridge. The wind was right, so we
decided to cross the pond, land, and have a
closer look at him. His head looked massive,
but I could not make out the points.</p>

<p>I certainly never had an easier stalk, as the
ground was perfect for stalking, and this holds
good all over the island. We walked quietly
up in perfect shelter to within about 150
yards of where we had last seen the stag, and
presently saw the tops of his horns sticking
up from behind a low bush. Leaving Steve
behind, I crawled up to within about seventy
yards and got my telescope on to count the
points. The horns were in velvet, but just
stripping&mdash;and as the frontal tines were interlocked
it was difficult to count the exact
number. Beckoning Steve up we spent some
time counting the points, for the poor beast
was lying sound asleep with his head nodding.
Steve could make out thirty points, but said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
we would get many better heads. We had
almost determined to leave him, when I thought
after all here was a certainty, so resting my
rifle in the branch of a tree in front of me, I
shot him through the neck. It was rather
murder, for no skill either in the stalk or shot
was necessary. However, he knew nothing,
but rolled over stone dead. When we got up
to him we could only make out twenty-nine
points, but the head was quite a pretty one.
The body was very big, but not in good
condition.</p>

<p>Calling up the men, we soon had the head and
meat down to the canoes and boiled the kettle
before starting on. We now had enough meat
for some days, though it is astonishing what a
quantity of meat an Indian can get through;
so we could afford to look for that extra good
head&mdash;which as it happened we never came
across.</p>

<p>We went on through some shallow and very
rocky steadies, and after about a mile came to
the last portage into Sandy Pond or Jubilee
Lake. We had to carry the canoes over this
and were soon crossing to the north shore of
Sandy Pond, where we were to make our permanent
camp. There was a fine following
wind which helped us along, and by sunset we
had covered the four miles of lake and arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
at one of Steve's trapping camps, which was to
be our headquarters.</p>

<p>Sandy Pond is a lovely sheet of water studded
with innumerable islands, some densely wooded,
some quite bare. In the early mornings and
evenings in fair weather the view was exquisite,
and I was never tired of the changing effects on
the lake. One day there would not be a ripple,
another day would come a gale and driving
rain, and such a sea that the canoes could not
be launched, but as a rule for three weeks we
had perfect weather.</p>

<p>In crossing Sandy Pond I caught four nice
trout, the two largest about 1&frac12; lb. each, so the
day's bag was two deer and eight trout. The
licence only allows the shooting of three stags,
but to shoot meat for food is, I think, an unwritten
law of the island, and I feel sure the
authorities themselves would not insist on a
too strict application of the licence. It is
simply impossible to carry enough tinned meat
to keep four men going, and with meat at
the door when it is urgently needed it is not
human nature to resist the temptation. On
the entire trip we shot only what was absolutely
necessary for food, but with no meat in camp I
used to send Steve out with the small rifle to
shoot a barren doe for the pot, and not a pound
of meat was wasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Our camp was pitched in a dense wood, for
after the great forests of Vancouver the Newfoundland
timber looks insignificant and only
worthy of the name of wood. A good clearing
had already been made by Steve on his trapping
expeditions, and poles for pitching the fly were
lying ready. We soon had a most comfortable
camp pitched, and with plenty of food and a
tot of rum to mark the occasion of arriving
in our permanent camp, we passed a happy
evening, smoking our pipes in front of a glorious
camp fire and discussing the plans and the
prospects for the future.</p>

<p>We decided to make this our main camp,
leaving here most of our stores, and to make
flying trips, at first west into the thickly wooded
country where the stags were most likely to be
found at this time of year, and later north-east
up to the barrens and Shoe Hill Ridge.</p>

<p>This was Steve's advice and I naturally
decided to follow it. I had originally thought
of working north by Mount Sylvester, striking
the higher waters of the Terra Nova River and
so down to the railway at Terra Nova, which
would have been a shorter way back to St.
John's; but Steve told me that last season he
had been with a party of Americans who came
in from Terra Nova, and that the country had
been shot out, as they never saw a decent stag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
till they came on to the barrens hear Shoe Hill
Ridge, where they could only stay for two days,
during which they secured two good stags.</p>

<p>The morning of September 2nd was exquisite,
all the clouds of yesterday had cleared away and
a bright sun was shining in a cloudless sky. I
had passed rather a bad night coughing, owing
to the chill caught the day before, but in the
climate of Newfoundland one never felt ill.</p>

<p>After an early breakfast we started off in
the big canoe to explore the shores of the lake
and look for signs. Stags we could not expect
to see, for they were bound to be in the woods,
and the whole of the northern shore of Sandy
Pond is densely wooded. About a mile west
of the camp was the brook connecting Sandy
Pond with the large lake of Kaegudeck to the
north. Here, I thought, must be the ideal spot
for trout, but though I fished for an hour I
never got a rise. The brook is only about ten
yards wide and quite unnavigable for canoes.</p>

<p>We found plenty of fresh marks of deer on
the sandy beaches of the lake, but saw nothing.</p>

<p>Returning to camp we pottered around
getting the camp shipshape&mdash;including the
making of my patent bed, which was a tremendous
success. Poles for hanging clothes,
rests for rifles and fishing-rods, shelves in my
tent, and even tables were run up by the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and the camp was soon all that could be
desired in the way of comfort.</p>

<p>About 4 o'clock we took the canoe and
went east about a mile, passing another brook
quite as big as that running from Kaegudeck
and which takes its rise in Shoe Hill Lake.
Landing, we went up to a look-out hill about
half-a-mile away, from which we had a splendid
view of the country to the east.</p>

<p>The ground, rugged and intersected with
small watercourses, rose gradually to a ridge
about three miles away, beyond which, Steve
said, lay an open plain leading on to Shoe Hill
Ridge. The hills looked about 400 feet high
and from our look-out we could spy the entire
face for some miles; to the south-east lay
Square Box Hill crowning the ridge. There
were many clumps of timber lining the sides of
the watercourses and numerous small ponds
lay in the hollows.</p>

<p>It looked an ideal caribou country, over which
later on in the season all the caribou from the
south and west cross to gain the barrens.</p>

<p>Many well-worn caribou tracks led upwards.
It was a lovely evening. We could look over
Sandy Pond with its wooded islands and its
forest-clothed shores standing out dark against
the setting sun and reflected in the placid
waters of the lake. Just as the sun went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in a blaze of colour we saw five deer come out
of different patches of wood, but only one was a
stag, and the head being poor we left him,
though to get a shot would have been a very
easy stalk.</p>

<p>In the short row home I picked up five trout,
two being over a pound. I found that just
half-an-hour before and half-an-hour after sunset
was the best time for trolling, and I could
always pick up enough fish for the camp coming
home in the canoe after a day's stalking.</p>

<p>Next morning, September 3rd, we were up
for an early breakfast and got away at 7 a.m.
Here I first used the rucksack, which was most
convenient, as in it we carried our midday meal,
an oilskin, if it looked like rain, and a kettle
for tea. The lake was dead calm and the
morning mists were clearing away as we started.
Our plan was to work up to the top of the ridge
we had seen the evening before, hunt the face
of the hill and see if there were any signs of
stags on the barrens.</p>

<p>Unfortunately our chances of deer on the
way up were spoiled by a south-west wind which
got up about eight o'clock, and blew steadily
from behind us the whole way up. We saw
four does on one of the islands in the lake, but
the whole face of the ridge was devoid of
stags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only about three miles to the crest of
the ridge, and the country being dry the going
was good. There were many small swamps and
ponds along the side of the hill with small
drokes in the hollows, altogether ideal ground
for stags. There were not many fresh tracks,
though the deep ruts cut by the hoofs of innumerable
herds of deer showed what numbers
must pass later on in the season.</p>

<p>On reaching the top of the ridge we looked
over a vast undulating tract of country, the
true barrens. There were only three drokes
in sight. One about four miles away, which
Steve pointed out to me as Shoe Hill Droke,
where Millais camped and from which he got
such fine heads in October; nearer still another
droke where Captain Legge had camped two
years before and from which he got a forty-pointer;
in fact, I was looking over historic
ground from a sporting point of view, and there
seemed no reasons why I should not be as
successful as those who had gone before me.</p>

<p>There were neither stags nor does in sight,
and no fresh tracks. Steve said they would
not move up to the barrens before the 15th
or 20th of September. It made me bitterly
regret I was so cramped for time, and that I
had to be back to catch the <i>Glencoe</i> at Belleoram
on September 26th. It is the greatest mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
being tied down to time on any hunting trip;
a week extra might have made all the difference
in my sport, but steamers did not fit in, and I
was bound to be in New York to sail for home
on October 8th.</p>

<p>We had a splendid view of the entire country
from the look-out hill on the top of the ridge.
To the north lay Mount Sylvester about four
hours' march away; to the north-west Lake
Kaegudeck, buried in dense woods; behind
Kaegudeck lay the hills over the Gander. To
the east the view was bounded by Shoe Hill
Ridge with its droke standing up against the
clear sky. To the west was the country we
had just come through sloping down to Sandy
Pond, while far behind to the west lay Kepskaig
Hill, which we were to visit later on. After
spending some time spying the entire country,
we boiled the kettle, had lunch and strolled
leisurely down to the lake. Meanwhile the
placid lake of the morning had changed and
the south-west wind, now blowing half a gale,
was rolling up big breakers on the shore. We
had sent the canoe home in the morning and it
was too rough for Joe to fetch us, so we went
back to the look-out of the first evening and
spied the whole country till dark. We saw
two stags up on the sky-line near Square Box
Hill, but it was too late to go after them; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
looked a heavy beast. The wind went down
with the setting sun and Joe was able to come
across for us, but the lake was still too rough for
fishing.</p>

<p>On September 4th the glass had fallen badly,
a gale was blowing and heavy rain clouds were
coming up from the south-west. Notwithstanding
the prospect of bad weather we
decided to go up to Square Box Hill and have
a look for the stag we had seen the previous
evening. It was a five miles' walk, up hill the
whole way, but the ascent was gradual. We
had just reached the top of the ridge within
about half-a-mile of the hill when the rain
came down in sheets. Spying was impossible,
so we took shelter in a droke, lit a good fire,
boiled the kettle and had lunch. We waited
till about two o'clock, but there was no sign of
clearing, so we plodded back to camp, getting
well soaked through. Just as we got to camp
the rain cleared off, and after a change of clothing
we started to fish about five o'clock. We
picked up five nice fish, all on the minnow&mdash;one
about 2 lb. Just at dusk a doe came
swimming out from one of the islands as if to
have a look at us. Meat was not over abundant
in camp, so I gave Steve permission to shoot her
with the rook rifle. Steve rather prided himself
on being a good shot, but he was shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from a wobbly canoe and missed clean with the
first shot, but hit her with the second, and landing,
killed her stone dead. By the time the doe
was gralloched and in the canoe a heavy fog
had come up and it was dark before we reached
camp.</p>

<p>On this trip I was introduced to two great
delicacies. One roast doe's head, and the other
roast breast-bone of stag. John was an adept
at these dishes, and anything more delicious and
tender I have never tasted. The head was
only skinned, put in the baker and roasted
whole for about six hours, the great advantage
of the baker being that the heat can be regulated
by the distance it is kept from the fire.</p>

<p>In the evening we had a long discussion as
to what we had better do. There were no stags
to speak of in the country we were in. So a
move was necessary, and Steve decided we
would take all the outfit to the west end of
Sandy Pond, there make our main camp, and
with a small camp work down to Kepskaig,
all through a wooded country where he maintained
the stags were now to be found. So we
decided to make a start the following morning.</p>

<p>Our camp was simply infested with grey
jays, generally known as robber-birds; there
were at least a dozen who made the camp their
home. No sooner was a bit of meat hung up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the open than they descended on it and began
picking it to pieces.</p>

<p>It was very interesting watching them, for
they were so tame that Joe caught one with his
hand. They appeared to be ravenous, and
stuffed themselves with meat and then flew
away, but Steve explained they only went a
short distance to store the meat for the bad
winter days to come, hiding it in crevices in
the bark of the surrounding trees. They
worked hard from morning to night and must
have laid by a good store, for I left a good lump
of venison hanging in the open for their special
benefit, the rest of the meat being protected
from the flies and the jays by my mosquito
net, which I had turned into a meat safe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

TO KOSK&#256;CODDE</h2>


<p>September 5th was a lovely morning, not
a breath of wind and a cloudless sky, so different
from yesterday. Getting away at 9.30 we
made a good four miles an hour, reaching our
camping ground at the west end of the lake at
11.30. Steve, Joe and I were in the big canoe
and John, a fine boatman, in the small canoe
which skirted the shores of the lake. We
disturbed a small stag which was feeding along
the shore and which at once disappeared in
the woods. The camp was simply perfect,
fairly open yet with sufficient shelter from the
surrounding woods. Behind it rose a hill about
100 feet high, a fine look-out over the entire
country. The tents were pitched on a spur of
land just where the Baie du Nord River, or
rather its head-waters, left the lake in a tumbling
torrent with intervening deep pools, an ideal
salmon river to look at, but unfortunately no
salmon can pass Smoky Falls, many miles away
to the south of Lake Meddonagonax.</p>

<p>I had caught two trout crossing the lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
but could not resist the first really good fly-fishing
water I had come to, so a few minutes
after arrival I was on the bank of the river
fishing an ideal pool. There was about a
quarter of a mile of fishing water, after which
was a small lake and then more rapids below.
In an hour I had landed twelve trout and char,
weighing 10&frac12; lb. The trout were all onannaniche
and played like sea trout&mdash;more often
out of the water than in. The largest was
2&frac14; lb., and the two largest char weighed
2&frac34; lb. In the heavy rapid water they gave
grand sport. What an ideal camp it was!
The best of fishing at the door of the tent, a
glorious view over the lake, with its many
wood-clad islands to the south, while across the
lake the ground was open and sloped gradually
upwards, and here Steve said he had more than
once seen good stags. The whole ground could
be spied from the rocky hill behind the camp,
from which, too, we could look over all the woodland
marshes to north and west and could see
the river winding away to distant Kosk&#257;codde,
and in the further distance Kepskaig Hill and
the country we were to hunt later on.</p>

<p>After lunch, about 3 o'clock, Steve and
I started for the look-outs. There were three
in all, behind and to the north of our camp.
We decided to go straight to the one farthest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
north, a mile away, and from which we could
command all the open ground near the lake
and the numerous glades and marshes lying
around us. Our only chance was to see a stag
coming out to feed about sunset.</p>

<p>The country was undulating, and on the
north side of the lake gradually rose to hills
about 200 feet high. Dense woods clothed
the ravines running up to the higher ground,
while between the woods and the surrounding
numerous small ponds were fairly open glades
interspersed with marshes. The track worn
by the feet of many caribou and cleared in
parts by Steve, who trapped this country in
the winter, was quite good going and we were
on the top of our hill long before sunset. The
view was a fine one; as we looked right over the
entire lake and away to the south we could see
the river winding down through the woods to
Lake Kosk&#257;codde, only about four miles away
as the crow flies. Kosk&#257;codde is the Indian
for the Mackle bird, or Little Gull Pond.</p>

<p>On our way up we saw the first sign of a stag
cleaning his antlers, and the fresh rubbing
showed that he had been on the ground quite
recently.</p>

<p>Having spied the entire country on both
sides and nothing being in sight, we decided to
return to camp. About half-a-mile from camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
we suddenly saw a big stag come out of the
woods and feed along a ridge just above the
shores of the lake. He was not more than
400 yards away and was walking rapidly as
he fed up wind and towards the camp. Waiting
until he had crossed the ridge and was out of
sight, we pushed on across a small dip between
us and the ridge, and so to the top of the ridge
where he had disappeared. It could hardly
be dignified by the name of a stalk, for on looking
over there he was standing about a hundred
yards away, feeding quietly. On the side towards
me the frontals and middles were good,
the tops poor, but stags were scarce, and
hoping for the best I dropped him with one
shot. It was the usual story, the two sides
were not alike and the horn next to me was the
best one. This is one of the great difficulties
of judging heads; on one side may be a fine
frontal of seven or eight points concealing the
other frontal, which may be a single spike.
He was a very heavy stag, in good condition
and quite clean, but I should say the head was
going back. In one respect it was remarkable&mdash;there
were three distinct horns, the third
with two points growing out of the orbital
ridge and completely separated from the horn
on the same side. Steve said he had never seen
one like it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning I sent Steve out early to
spy the country. He came back having seen
only one very small stag and three does. Joe
was dispatched to cut up yesterday's stag,
and bring in the head and meat, while I
decided to fish the river down and go out
again in the evening on the chance of another
stag.</p>

<p>Taking Steve with me, I fished down for about
two miles. There was some lovely water, but
all the fish were lying in the pools and none in
the streams.</p>

<p>In the lowest pool I reached I got a fine fish
of 3 lb. and five other good ones. By lunch
I had twenty-one trout and five char, weighing
19 lb.; a number of small ones I had put back.
The trout were all onannaniche and as game a
fish for its size as I ever want to catch; in the
heavy water they gave grand sport. Coming
back to camp we saw two old geese and a fine
lot of young ones feeding in a marsh across a
small lake. Seeing us they kept cackling and
moving higher up into the reeds. We both
went back to camp to fetch the rook rifle, so
making a great mistake, for had one of us
remained where we were we certainly would
have got a shot, for they would not have left
the marsh so long as some one was in sight,
guarding the narrow mouth of the river by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
which they were bound to pass. When we
got back with the rifle they had disappeared.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went out to the second
look-out, and waited till sunset. It was a
wonderful evening, not a breath of wind, and
the mosquitoes and flies were out in force even
on the top of our little hill. In a small pond
below us half-a-dozen black duck were
swimming about through the reeds, while
the hundreds of rings on the water showed
that the pond was well stocked with trout,
but Steve said they were all very small and not
worth catching; the pond must have been
simply alive with them judging from the
number of rises.</p>

<p>Presently we saw a barren doe come out of
the woods and feed towards where we had shot
yesterday's stag. The sound of chopping wood
in camp was quite distinct in the still air, and
whether it was hearing this or whether she had
winded where the dead stag had lain, she
turned back and swam straight out into the
lake for about 300 yards, then turned north
and swam at least a mile to a jutting out
wooded point where she landed, shook herself
like a dog and disappeared in the woods. She
swam very high in the water with her scut
straight up. It was a pretty sight, as I could
watch her all the way with my glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>I was not very satisfied with the system of
hunting we were obliged to follow. Sitting
waiting on the top of a look-out on the chance
of something turning up did not appeal to me,
but Steve assured me it was much too early
to go up to the barrens and that our only chance
was in the woods, and I have no doubt he was
right. The stags do not move up to the high
ground much before September 20th, though
I believe the Shoe Hill country and right away
east holds stags permanently, but the big
stags who have summered in the woods do not
begin to move much before the 20th. The
season closing on October 1st, there is not much
time for good stags. The close time is from
October 1st to 20th, when shooting is again
allowed. I have a shrewd suspicion that men
who go in about October 5th, to be in time for
the second season, are not very particular about
dates. I feel I should be sadly tempted myself
were I to see a forty-five pointer, say October
16th. But when the rutting season is on,
between October 1st and 20th, the stags are
easily approachable and the sport cannot be
good.</p>

<p>We discussed our plans at length&mdash;there were
not many big stags about, and though the camp
was an ideal one I decided, on Steve's recommendation,
to move down south to Lake Kosk&#257;codde
and Kepskaig, where, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
country was fairly wooded, Steve said we
should have a chance of a good stag.</p>

<p>On September 7th the weather looked like
breaking. Steve was out at daybreak and spied
two stags down the river where we proposed to
go. We decided to leave Joe in camp and take
a light camp and provisions for a week in the
big canoe and explore the country to the south.
Joe was rather sad at being left behind, but
though he had a good tent, lots of meat and
provisions, the enforced solitude did not appeal
to him.</p>

<p>While Steve and John were packing the canoe
I went down to the river and soon had ten trout
and char, 8&frac12; lb., the two biggest being over
2 lb. each. The canoe was let down the rapids
with a rope, the kit being portaged to the
bottom of the rapids, only about 400 yards,
where the river fell into a small lake or Podopsk,
a generic term for all the small ponds in the
course of a river. After crossing this we had
a navigable stream with occasional rapids, all
of which we were able to negotiate without
unloading. Having started at 9 a.m. we
reached a rapid at the entrance to Kosk&#257;codde
about 1.15. Here we had to portage about
fifty yards. I slipped on the rocks and took
an involuntary bath, which was rather annoying.
However, a change of clothes was at hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
I was none the worse for my dip. Just as we
got into the new lake I saw a deer make off on
the far side, having seen us. I could not make
out whether it was a stag or a hind, as I only
saw its rump disappearing in the trees. At the
same moment John saw a stag feeding quietly
away on our side of the lake. We soon got
close enough to see that the head was a poor
one. I tried to take a snapshot with the
camera, but when I got within fifty yards he
saw me and was off. He was a fine big-bodied
beast, and may have been one of the stags Steve
had seen in the morning. We pushed on about
one mile, and camped on a promontory stretching
out into the lake. There was a nice sandy
shelving beach and a perfect camping ground
all ready, as it had been cleared by some other
party the previous year, and only the undergrowth
had to be cut away.</p>

</div>

<p>In the afternoon, taking the canoe, we
paddled quietly along the shore, and after about
two miles landed on a sandy beach to look for
signs. A fringe of wood clothed the south
shore of the lake, beyond which was a fairly
open country. There were plenty of signs, and
we were strolling quietly along the beach when
Steve seized me by the arm and whispered,
"Deer coming through wood." I confess I
could hear nothing, but Steve's hearing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
marvellously acute. Sitting down on a big
rock, I got the rifle ready and laid it across my
knees. Presently I heard a crackling and
breaking of branches quite close by, when a
noble-looking stag walked out into the open
and without looking round or ahead crossed
the sandy beach down to the edge of the lake
not thirty yards away. We were both in full
view, but alas, though his body looked enormous
his head was a very poor one, not more than
twenty points. He never saw me but bent his
head, had a long drink, then looked round for a
couple of minutes and walked quietly back into
the wood. What would I not have given for
my camera!&mdash;a more perfect picture could not
be imagined. Though a gentle breeze was
blowing, fortunately in the right direction, there
was not a ripple on the waters of the sandy bay,
which was sheltered by the wood, and as he
stood with his head up and every line of his
body reflected in the water below, it was a
noble sight, such as one could but rarely hope
to see.</p>

[<i>To face page 226.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Allowing some ten minutes to elapse we
followed him through the wood, more out of
curiosity than anything else. Coming out on
to an open grassy plain, there he was feeding
quietly about 200 yards away. Looking
round to my left I suddenly saw a second
stag not 150 yards away. The horns of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
first stag were clean. The second stag had
a better head, but the velvet was peeling off
and the frontal tines, and indeed most of the
horn, were crimson with blood. It was difficult
to determine the points, owing to the bits of
velvet hanging all about, but getting the glass
on to him I saw that though the frontals were
good the rest of the head was very indifferent,
so he had too to be passed.</p>

<p>We whistled to move the second stag but he
took not the slightest notice of us, and it was
not until we gave him, and incidentally the
first stag, our wind that they both went away
over the plain at a slinging trot.</p>

<p>Coming home in the gloaming we saw another
stag come out of the wood and walk along the
shore. We got within fifty yards of him, but
the head was, if possible, inferior to the
other two. This was bad luck! We had seen
four stags in one day and not one worth
shooting.</p>

<p>September 8th. We got away at 6 a.m.,
crossed the lake in the canoe and made for the
top of a small hill about a mile away. The
country was undulating. Numerous ponds lay
in the hollows. Clumps of wood (drokes), in
which the stags rested during the day, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
scattered over the plain; altogether a likely
looking ground. We soon saw a big stag about
two miles away feeding across a swamp. The
head looked a good one but it was impossible
to make out the points at such a distance, so
we decided to get nearer. As we moved on we
saw another stag coming out of a hollow on
our left, but the head was a poor one. Within
four minutes we saw a third stag on our right,
but the glass soon showed that he too was not
of the right sort. All these were big-bodied
animals, but carrying poor heads. Following
on after the first stag, we saw him enter a small
wood. As soon as we got close outside the
wood I decided to send Steve round and give
the stag his wind. I took a position commanding
both sides of the wood, on one of which, if
Steve's drive were successful, the stag must
come out. After about half-an-hour's wait a
crash in the wood just in front of me told me
that our plan had succeeded, and out burst a
fine stag and stood looking back into the wood
and within twenty yards of me. Alas, his
horns were in velvet, and although the tops
were good he had only one indifferent frontal
and a spike for the other. So he too had to go
unharmed. Again I reproached myself for
not having brought the camera. I had missed
yesterday and to-day two chances of snapshots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
such as seldom occur. On getting back
to camp John reported having seen a small
stag crossing the end of the lake, so at least
there were plenty of caribou in the country,
though unfortunately no big heads.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the light breeze dropped
to a dead calm, so starting at 2.30 we made for
the far west end of the lake, about five miles
away, where a long steady ran up for about
three miles, and which Steve said was a good
country for deer. Landing a few hundred
yards up the steady, we made for the top of a
ridge about a hundred feet high, up which led
one of the deepest deer tracks I had yet seen.
It was at least two feet deep, cut right into the
side of the hill, and there were fresh signs
everywhere. Unfortunately it was one of
those dead calm evenings when the stags come
out very late, and as we were a good way from
camp we could only wait till just after sunset,
and saw nothing. On our way home just at
the mouth of the steady we saw a barren hind
standing in the water. As we wanted meat I
sent Steve ashore with the rook rifle to get her,
which he did after bungling one or two shots.
As we were getting the carcass into the canoe,
out came another hind, and just behind her a
small stag, on the point we had just left, but
the head was no good. We got to camp well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
after dark, but it was a lovely, calm night
without a ripple on the lake.</p>

<p>September 9th. We were up at daybreak
and across the lake to spy the ground where
we had seen the three stags yesterday. Nothing
was in sight, but we saw for a moment one
stag behind our camp on the high open ground;
he was just disappearing into a small droke, so
we could not make out the head. However,
we went after him, but when we had crossed the
pond and got up to where he had disappeared,
there was nothing in sight, so we decided to
get back to camp and move on if possible.
Just as we reached the camp, looking back for
a moment I saw him on the sky-line about a
quarter of a mile away, but, getting the glass
on, I found the head was no good. As we were
making for camp we saw another stag on the
shore where we had landed in the morning,
but he was like all the rest, unshootable. He
both got our wind and saw us and went off at a
real gallop instead of the ordinary long slinging
trot.</p>

<p>We certainly had seen plenty of stags, but
as luck would have it not one good head. All
the country round Kosk&#257;codde was very good
for deer. We had been extraordinarily lucky
so far in our weather, the "mishes" were all
dry but rather fatiguing going, just like walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
over a thick bed of dry sponges. The fine
weather could not be expected to last for ever,
and the chances were that when we most
wanted it, on the Shoe Hill Ridge, it would
break.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

SPORT ON KEPSKAIG</h2>


<p>Though the wind was almost blowing a gale
against us we decided to start, and crept along
under the shelter of the shore. Heavy seas
were breaking over the numerous sunken rocks
and we shipped a good deal of water. I was
not sorry to reach a point about three miles
off, where the lake turned round to the north
and where we had a following wind, and though
the waves were still high they were behind
us, and we soon reached a short rapid leading
into Kepskaig Lake. We had covered the
distance from our last camp in three and a half
hours.</p>

<p>Unloading the canoe, we got her over the
rapid and camped immediately below. In
front of the camp, at the bottom of the short
rapid, was a nice pool, and while the men were
pitching camp and cooking dinner I fished the
pool, and in one and a half hours I got twenty-one
trout and char; the biggest about 1&frac12; lb.</p>

<p>Although the gale was a strong one the rain
had so far kept off, but the clouds were now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
piling up for heavy rain, and the glass was
falling rapidly. We were lucky to have got
across, for the wind was now too high to have
attempted the lake. We were in a good, dry
camp, plenty of fish assured, and we could afford
to ignore the weather.</p>

<p>Kepskaig was a short and somewhat narrow
lake, not more than one and a half miles long;
from it two steadies led out into Meddonagonax
Lake. The shores were thickly wooded, but
at the far end were some fairly open marshes
with two good look-out hills, from which we
could spy the entire country.</p>

<p>We started about 4.30 for the far end of the
lake, but landed half-way to spy the shores for
any feeding stag that might come out. We
soon saw a stag with a good-looking head
feeding on the shore opposite to us, and were
just about to start after him when Steve saw
another stag feeding across one of the marshes
at the far end of the lake. The tops of the
horns looked very good, so we decided to go
after him first. Pushing on in the canoe to
the end of the lake, we were soon on the top of
one of the small hills, and could see him feeding
on towards us and moving very quickly. The
glass showed that though he had good tops,
both middles and frontals were very poor, so
we decided to leave him and go back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
first stag. It was nearly dark when we got
to the place we had last seen him, but
fortunately he was there still feeding amongst
some big boulders on the shore of the lake. A
high wind was blowing and he was not more
than eighty yards away, so hidden by the rocks
and long grass I could not make out his frontals,
but tops and middles were good, and waiting,
what seemed an indefinite time, to get a broadside
shot, at last he began feeding away with
his rump straight on to me. I could now
hardly see the telescope sight, but fortunately
he gave a half turn and as I fired I heard the
bullet go home. He galloped madly right
into the lake, and stood some 150 yards
away among some big rocks from which I
could hardly distinguish him. Taking the
best sight I could I fired again and he
dropped stone dead in the water. Getting
him ashore, we found he was a nice thirty-four
pointer, the best head we had yet seen, and as
it happened the best head we saw the whole
trip. He was in poor condition, having been
badly wounded in the body at some time.
Abscesses had formed round the wounds and
Steve pronounced his flesh uneatable. It was
too dark to do more than pull him out of the
water and gralloch him, and we had a hard
paddle back to camp in the dark. The rain
was now falling heavily and a roaring fire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
cosy camp were more than welcome.</p>

<p>The following morning it was still raining,
but more like a thick Scotch mist. We went
over to fetch the head, and found that the first
bullet had gone in just behind the ribs and
raked him through lungs and heart, so the
second shot was unnecessary. We saw a hind
and calf swimming in the lake, and tried to
overtake them to get a snapshot, but hard as
we both paddled I only succeeded in getting
within about thirty yards, too far for a good
photo&mdash;the light too was bad, and the result
was not a success. I spent the morning
sketching and photoing the head, and then
Steve set to work to skin and clean it. After
breakfast there was great excitement, as four
otters came swimming up to the rapid, possibly
with the idea of going up into the lake above.
Regardless of season and game laws, Steve
had a shot with the small rifle and missed, but
turned them back. Going out to fish I could
not get a rise, the otters had evidently scared
all the fish out of the pool.</p>

<p>The clouds now cleared away and a brilliant
sun came out, while hardly a ripple stirred the
surface of the lake. In the afternoon we went
down again to the end of the lake, climbed
the highest look-out hill and stayed there till
sunset. The views on all sides were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
beautiful and we looked right over Meddonagonax
with its numerous wooded islands, but
saw no stags. We paddled down one of the
steadies leading into Meddonagonax and so
into the lake, hoping to see some feeding stag
on its shores, but without success.</p>

</div>

<p>It was a wonderful night, the moonlight
made it almost as bright as day.</p>

<p>The following morning was bright and cold
and the mists hanging over the lake were soon
dispelled by the morning sun. We got away
about 6.30 a.m. and went down to the far end
of the lake, but only saw one unshootable
stag. Coming back for breakfast we decided
to take a trip to the far end of Meddonagonax,
where Steve said there was good fishing just
where the river left the lake. It only took us
one and a half hours of a steady row and paddle
to get to the end of the lake where the Baie
du Nord River leaves it. We ran down a few
hundred yards of rapids and hauled up the
canoe, leaving John to prepare lunch. It was
an ideal-looking river and Steve said he had
caught many large trout in it. The pools were
perfect to look at, but somehow fish were comparatively
few and not in very good condition.
I fished down about a mile to where the river
fell into a small lake, and caught eighteen trout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
weighing about nine pounds. Steve said it
was only a good day's march from where we
were to where the river runs into the sea.
About half-way down there is a big fall called
Smoky Falls, above which salmon cannot run,
but he said salmon were numerous below the
falls. In the water we had fished he had
caught many big trout in July, so possibly we
were too late.</p>

<p>Leaving at 5 o'clock I trolled all the way
home but never got a pull nor did we see a stag.</p>

<p>As we had apparently exhausted the ground,
we decided to start back in the morning of
the 12th and camp in a steady at the west end
of Kosk&#257;codde. While John was packing up
we had an early morning prowl round the
shores in the canoe, but saw nothing. While
the packing was being finished I fished the
pool at the camp and got thirteen trout weighing
7&frac12; lb.&mdash;the largest about 1&frac12; lb. It was a
blazing hot day, we got to our new camping
ground shortly after midday, and only caught
one trout on the way.</p>

<p>Going out in the evening we crossed some
ideal-looking caribou ground, but saw only one
stag with a poor head and a couple of hinds.</p>

<p>All our hopes were now centred on the Shoe
Hill Ridge country, for though we had seen
many stags we were most unfortunate as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
regards heads. This was the seventh day away
from the main camp, and we had seen fourteen
stags. I cannot help thinking it was a bad
year for heads, or surely we should have seen
something better.</p>

<p>I sent Steve out early on the morning of
the 13th to spy, but he came back and reported
nothing in sight.</p>

<p>We got away about 9.30, and with a favourable
wind were soon passing our old camp on
Kosk&#257;codde.</p>

<p>Joe had been uneasy about us, or lonely, and
we met him tramping down the river, and,
incidentally, disturbing the whole country.
He reported a stag (of course a colossal one)
which had passed quite close to our old camp.
It was lucky no gun was left behind, for he most
certainly would have had a shot.</p>

<p>About dinner-time we reached a small lake
from which the river ran out in a sluggish
stream. Steve said it was a favourite spot
for trout and suggested I should try it while
lunch was being got ready. There was a deep
hole just above the stream and a light wind
was rippling the water. The trout was there
in numbers and greedy for the fly. At every
cast I rose one or two, and in an hour and a
half I had forty trout weighing 19&frac12; lb., the
biggest about 2 lb. I lost one which must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
been at least 3 lb., and put back at least a
dozen small ones. I never saw trout in such
numbers or so eager to take the fly.</p>

<p>It was nice to get back to the cheery camp
on Sandy Grove Pond, and to my comfortable
camp bed, but Joe had spoiled all chance of
stags. We saw a good covey of grouse close
to the camp, but they were very wild. I
thought Joe would never go to sleep he had so
much to say to his pals, and his stag grew
bigger and bigger as the evening wore on,
perhaps due to a tot of rum which was served
out to celebrate our meeting.</p>

<p>The morning of the 14th broke grey with a
light rain, and the glass was falling, but there
was no wind. I went down to fish the river for
the last time while the men were packing up.
In my favourite pool I took eleven fine trout,
weighing 14 lb., four others in the smaller
streams, 2 lb., and seven in crossing the lake,
5 lb.&mdash;a total for the day of twenty-two trout,
21 lb. I lost a fly in a good trout in the big
pool. I fished the streams down till Steve
came to say that all was ready for a start.
As we passed the pool I chaffingly said, "I
must get that trout which broke me." At the
first cast I hooked a 2-lb. fish, and on landing
him Steve quietly remarked, "Quite right,
here is your fly," and sure enough there it was!
Crossing the lake we saw two stags and landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to look at them, but again the heads were no
good. The wind was rising and the rain
coming down ere we reached our main camp on
Sandy Grove Pond about 2.30 p.m. Time was
now getting short, so we decided to push on
to the Shoe Hill Ridge and there hope for a big
stag as the deer began moving out of the woods.
The evening was wild and wet, so we stayed in
camp making arrangements for the morrow's
march inland.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

TO THE SHOE HILL COUNTRY</h2>


<p>The morning of the 15th was grey, and
though the glass was falling, the weather
looked like clearing. The men dawdled about
and it was 11 before we all got away. Our
plans were to take three good packs up to Shoe
Hill Ridge and then send Joe back for what we
wanted from time to time.</p>

<p>We had kippered all the big trout and very
excellent they were later on, for no fish were
to be had on the barrens.</p>

<p>We reached the top of the ridge about
1 o'clock, when heavy rain set in. As I could
not walk in an oilskin, there was nothing for
it but to get wet through, and very soon I was
literally wet to the skin. We were all shivering
with cold as a bitter wind was blowing over
the open barrens, so at 2 o'clock we halted to
boil the kettle under the shelter of a big rock.
Though wet through, the men were as cheery
as ever, and Steve challenged Joe to race him
to the top of a small hill which was Millais'
look-out when he was camped in the Shoe Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Droke. They came back having seen nothing.
We plodded along, a sorry crew, in the pouring
rain, but somewhat refreshed by the hot tea.</p>

<p>As we came in sight of a big lake lying south
of the Shoe Hill Droke for which we were bound,
we saw a good stag lying on the far side of the
lake. The head certainly looked the biggest
I had seen, but it was hard to use the telescope
in the rain and I could not make out the points.
However, both Steve and I saw that he had
very big frontals, though I could only make out
two points on the tops.</p>

<p>The wind was all wrong and to get a stalk
meant going right round the lake, about three
miles. The other two men would have had
to wait in the rain, and as we were all feeling
pretty wretched, we decided to leave him and
push on to camp. The decision was mine and
I shall always regret it, for I believe he carried
the best head we saw on the trip, but I thought
as we were to hunt for a week on the Shoe Hill
Ridge we had a fair chance of coming on him
again, so we passed on to camp. He got our
wind at least a mile away and cleared out over
a ridge and never was seen again. We got to
camp about 5 o'clock and were soon warming
and drying ourselves before a roaring fire.</p>

<p>We were now in the Shoe Hill Droke, and in
the centre of what Millais described as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
finest caribou country he had seen in Newfoundland.
There was, however, one great
difference. He had been there the end of
October, when all the stags had moved up.
It was now only the 15th September, and it
remained to be seen what our luck would be.</p>

<p>While getting everything shipshape I found
my telescope sight was missing. Steve always
carried it slung over his shoulder and must
have left it behind at one of our halts. He
assured me it would be "all right" and that
he would go out at daybreak and bring it in,
which he did. This was the first really uncomfortable
day we had had&mdash;but our troubles
were soon forgotten, and over a roaring camp
fire and with a tot of rum each, we looked
forward hopefully to our prospects for the next
few days. The morning of the 16th was fine,
the sun was shining brightly, the glass was
rising, a fresh north-east wind was blowing,
altogether a perfect stalking day.</p>

<p>The Shoe Hill Droke lay on a slight rise above
the Shoe Hill Lake. The droke was a general
camping ground for shooting and trapping
parties, and the remains of many camps were
scattered through the wood. To the north
lay Mount Sylvester, some seven miles
away, with a fine open country between; to
the south the view was bounded by a ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
about three miles away. A similar ridge lay
about the same distance to the east, while to
the west lay the country we had crossed the
day before. The whole country was undulating
and there were scattered clumps of wood
affording nice shelter for stags. We could hunt
in every direction and could not possibly have
been in a better centre. The ground was
hard and dry, and it was certainly the best
walking in the island.</p>

<p>We started north about 9 a.m., and covered
a lot of ground, walking continuously until
6 p.m., with an hour's rest for a midday meal.
We saw four stags that day, and though two
looked shootable, yet after a long tramp in
each case we found the horns no good, which
was a great disappointment, for we had worked
really hard.</p>

<p>We also saw for the first time two bands of
hinds, one of six with two small very young
stags and one of four. We came on the spot
where Millais had shot his forty-nine pointer
and Steve pointed with pride to the bones
still lying about, also to the scene of Captain
Lumsden's thirty-seven pointer, but it was a
poor satisfaction to me to know my predecessors
on the ground had got such fine
trophies if I could not find a shootable beast.</p>

<p>Millais, Captain Lumsden, Captain Legge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and Mr. Littledale had all shot this country
with Steve, who certainly knew every inch of it,
but October is the month for the Shoe Hill
Ridge, when the sport must be grand, for all
the stags from the north as well as those from
the wooded country all round come up to these
barrens in the late autumn. The country was
cut up with deep trails, showing where the
stags passed on their annual migration south.</p>

<p>For pleasure I should choose the early
season, up to October 1st; the weather is
finer and some fishing is to be had, but for
good heads the late season is certainly the best,
for all the stags are out in the open during and
after the rut. In the end of October the
weather is sometimes fine, but sometimes very
broken, and Steve told me that he had more than
once hunted in heavy snow in that month.</p>

<p>On our return to camp everything was most
comfortable&mdash;benches, tables, shelves in the
tent, rests for the rifles; only the big stag was
wanted to make the Shoe Hill Droke a hunter's
earthly paradise.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th we struck east
and crossed two ridges till we got to a valley
between Shoe Hill Ridge and the hill on which
was the Kesoquit Droke, where Millais had
camped on his way up from the Long Harbour
River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking down into the valley, we saw a good
stag as regards body and two smaller ones.
The head was a pretty open one, but the middles
and frontals were poor, so we left him alone.
I picked up a single horn with eighteen good
points close by. We saw two more stags a
long way off and went after them, but the
distance was much greater than I thought.
On our way we saw another small stag come
out of a droke and walk quietly up a slight
rise, where he was joined by a still smaller
one from the far side of the ridge. Neither had
shootable heads. They both went in for what
Steve called their "standing sleep," stuck
their legs out and remained perfectly motionless
with the head drooping till it almost
touched the ground; occasionally they woke
up with a start, but were soon sound asleep
again. It was a most comical sight and
lasted for about a quarter of an hour. I
crawled up within about sixty yards without
any difficulty and could easily have shot them
both. The little stag woke up first, but it was
not till we showed ourselves that the bigger
stag moved away in a most dignified manner,
giving two or three most beautiful chances
before he went out of sight.</p>

<p>While Steve was boiling the kettle I went
on to a little hillock to spy the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
saw the two stags we were first after, but
again the heads were no good.</p>

<p>I heard a rustle behind me and, thinking
it was Steve coming up to call me to dinner,
turned round and saw a hind feeding beside
me, not five yards away. She started when she
saw me, but moved away quite quietly. While
eating our midday meal two more hinds fed
quietly up to within a few yards and passed
by without showing any signs of fear. This
country was certainly full of deer, but none
of the right sort. When we stopped for
dinner we were within one and a half miles of
the Kesoquit Droke, which is only about four
miles from the head-waters of the Long
Harbour River. From a small hillock we
could see the entire country and the hills over
Long Harbour, while away to the east was the
conical hill known as the "Tolt." The ground
looked very much the same as far as the eye
could reach and should be a grand hunting
country in October. We could also see the
waters of the Maelpeg Lake, about three miles
away. Returning to camp, we saw a black
fox in the distance, which made Steve's mouth
water, as he said he could sell a good skin for
two hundred and forty dollars.</p>

<p>Altogether the day had been a very interesting
one. We had seen seven stags and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
number of does, but unfortunately no good
heads.</p>

<p>On the 18th the weather broke badly, the
glass fell 7/10ths, a gale of wind and heavy
driving rain made stalking impossible and kept
us in camp all day. Towards evening the
wind went round and the rain stopped, and
then we saw a wonderful sunset, the heavy
rain clouds drifting away across a golden red
setting sun. We saw a stag on the sky-line
about two miles away, but too late to go after
him.</p>

<p>On the 19th the wind had come round to
the north, and it was a bright, lovely morning.
We took the ground to the north-west, working
round by where we had seen the stag the
previous evening. We covered a lot of ground
and altogether stalked four separate stags,
only to find, on getting up to them, that the
heads were no good. We must have walked
over fifteen miles, but in the bracing air of the
barrens fatigue was unknown. We saw another
black fox to-day a long way off, and
Steve said he would be back trapping in three
weeks and hoped to get the two black foxes.
I picked up a single horn with twenty-two
points, very short and thick. There were
eight points on the top just like a frontal tine.</p>

<p>The morning of the 20th was very cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
grey, but we hoped it would clear up, so started
away over the ridge to the south-west. On
topping the ridge, we looked down on a great
marshy plain with a few scattered drokes.
Nothing was in sight, so we walked quietly on
towards one of the drokes, from behind which
suddenly burst out five hinds pursued by what
looked like a good stag, who was grunting as he
followed the hinds&mdash;the first rutting stag we had
seen. They paid so little attention to us that
they were almost on top of us before they saw
us. Unfortunately, the head was poor, as
he gave an easy shot. Almost immediately
after two herds of hinds passed us, while in
the distance two more stags were seen feeding
about three miles away. We went on towards
them, when the rain set in and we had to find
shelter for lunch. There was no sign of the
weather clearing and stalking was impossible
in the heavy rain and mist, so we plodded
wearily back to camp, which we reached
after dark, wet to the skin. This valley was
full of grouse; we saw seven good coveys and
I shot three birds for the pot with the small
rifle.</p>

<p>The rain continued all night, but stopped
about 7 a.m. on the morning of the 21st.</p>

<p>We had come up to Shoe Hill Ridge on the
15th in heavy rain. It had rained on the 18th
and again on the 20th, so three days out of six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
were spoiled. The whole country was now
soaked with the rain, little rivulets had become
torrents, and the marshes were knee deep in
water. It seemed useless to remain on, as it
meant my missing my steamer in New York,
so we decided to pack up and get out.</p>

<p>Looking back, I think this was a mistake.
I might have spent another week in this grand
country and taken a later boat home. Some
big stags might have come up from the woods.
On the other hand, the weather was broken
and even Steve was in favour of moving. All
along he regretted that I had not come in for
the October shooting, when, he said, I was
bound to have got good heads. He was just
as keen as I was and sorry to leave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

HOMEWARD BOUND</h2>


<p>Just as we had packed up a fearful thunderstorm
came on which lasted over an hour, and
we did not get away till 11.45, arriving at
Sandy Pond at 3 o'clock, wet through. The
water was pouring down the hill sides, every
deep deer track was a torrent, and it was heavy
going through the marshes. We had a meal
and a change of clothes, and, packing the
canoes, reached the portage into Sandy Pond
at dusk. The evening was fine; we pitched
camp in a nice droke and over a good hot supper
at 9 o'clock the discomforts of the day were
soon forgotten. By the aneroid the Shoe Hill
Droke was 370 feet above the level of Sandy
Grove Pond. There was just a last chance of
a stag, as Steve said there was some good
ground in the direction of where I had shot the
first stag. I sent him out at daybreak on the
22nd, and he came back reporting three stags
about half-a-mile away, one of which he
thought was a good one.</p>

<p>We started away and found them feeding in
an open marsh without any cover but three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
great boulders about 800 yards from where
they were. The biggest stag had a very pretty
head, but careful examination with the glass
decided me to let him go. Steve said, "Pity
that not forty-pointer." The position looked
so impossible that I told Steve we never could
have got a stalk or a shot. "I drive him,"
said Steve. Wishing to see how he would
manage it I told him to go ahead, while I lay
behind the big boulder; meanwhile the stags
lay down. He took a tremendous round and
presently I saw him about a mile on the other
side of the stags, who at the moment got his
wind, rose and began to trot away, but not
towards me. Suddenly I saw Steve trotting
along to turn them, which he did most successfully,
for the three stags came along at a swinging
trot, the big one behind, and passed in the
open about 150 yards from me. The shot
was such a sporting one I could not resist it,
and as the thud of the bullet came back to me
the stag dashed forward at a gallop and rolled
over stone dead, shot through the heart. My
last stalk and shot of the trip. I cannot
pretend that stalking caribou is a high form
of sport. If the wind is right and there are
not too many hinds about one can take any
liberties. Of all the animals I have shot the
caribou seems to me the most stupid and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
easiest to bag under ordinary circumstances.</p>

</div>

<p>I had a special permit to shoot five stags,
but only shot four, not counting the deer we
had to shoot for meat, generally hinds.</p>

<p>We soon had the meat in the canoes. The
brooks and shallow steadies were now full up
from the heavy rains, so we poled where we had
to portage coming in. The rain was falling
in torrents. We saw our last stag as we came
up to Red Hill Pond, but he had no head to
speak of. By 4.30 we reached Red Hill Pond,
which was up over two feet. The rain was so
bad we decided to camp, and soon had a fire as
big as a house going, before which we dried ourselves;
the men just as cheerful as if it had
been bright sunshine. It was an awful night,
a gale tearing through the tops of the trees,
and the rain coming down in sheets; but the
morning of the 23rd was fine, as the wind had
come round to the north, and we made an
early start as we hoped to reach Ryan's by
nightfall. I had had bad luck; I had seen
and stalked forty-two stags and never saw one
really good head. I think it must have been
a bad year for heads, or Millais, Lumsden,
Legge and Littledale had cleared the best stags
off the ground. A party of Americans had
come over from the east the previous year, but
spent only two days on the Shoe Hill Ridge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
got two good stags.</p>

<p>Steve now regretted that we had not gone
back by the Terra Nova river and lake. He
said we could have shot every rapid without
unloading and would have reached St. John's
much quicker than by going back to Belleoram.
With a gale of wind behind us, but no rain, we
made good time. The two-mile brook was in
heavy flood and we poled the canoe up and
reached the old camp on Hungry Grove Pond
by 11.</p>

<p>Here I left all the provisions that were left
over, the fly for the men and the kit I was
giving them as a present, and we started for a
fifteen-mile tramp to Ryan's at 11.45.</p>

<p>The ground was saturated and we only
reached the top of the hill above Ryan's at
dark. It was awful going down the hill in the
dark, and the men fell with their packs more
than once. We simply waded and stumbled
along till we saw the welcome lights of the
house at 7.30 p.m.&mdash;a real hard day's work.
I shot five grouse on the way. By the aneroid
the top of the six-mile hill was 800 feet above
the sea-level at Ryan's.</p>

<p>Ryan was away, but I received a hearty
welcome from his niece. The question now
was what was to be done? There was no
schooner or sailing boat of any kind; however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
as usual, Steve and John were not to be defeated,
but said they would row me down to
Anderson's Cove in the fishing dory.</p>

</div>

<p>The morning of the 24th was lovely and calm,
but a wind sprang up just as we got away and
it was soon blowing a gale in our teeth and we
were shipping heavy seas. Steve and John
struggled gallantly on, but at 2 o'clock we
had to halt, as we could make no way. After
about two hours, when we were considering
how we could pass the night, the wind dropped
as suddenly as it rose and we reached John
Saunders' house just at dark. Anderson's
Cove was two miles farther on. Saunders was
a fine specimen of the old settler, and his house
was a picture of cleanliness and neatness. The
sails of his schooner were unbent, so we decided
to go on to the Cove where the leading trader,
Mr. Thornhill, lived, and Steve said he had a
sailing boat and could put us across next
morning. There was a slight difficulty about
this, as one of the hands wanted a guarantee of
so many dollars a day should he be detained in
Belleoram. I cut matters short by sending a
wire to Saunders to bend his sails and come
over as early as he could in the morning. I
think my friends at Anderson's Cove were a
bit disappointed when Saunders and his smart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
boat came across with a spanking breeze and
picked us up about 9 a.m. We had all slept
on the floor at Thornhill's, but had an excellent
supper of a whole cod boiled with potatoes.</p>

<p>We had a lovely sail across to Belleoram&mdash;Saunders
and a fine strapping son being the
crew. The boat was as smart and clean as a
yacht, and the two Saunders were the best type
I had yet met of the Newfoundland settlers.</p>

<p>Steve and John came for the trip as cheery
as ever, though their badly blistered hands
showed the work of yesterday. By 12.30 I
was at Belleoram, and by 1 o'clock the men
were on their way back to Long Harbour. As
Steve said good-bye it was really quite touching.
"You treat us very well, you very good man.
Come again, and God bless you." I certainly
never parted with men with such regret and
never want better friends or hunting comrades.</p>

<p>Being Sunday, Belleoram was very quiet.
Mrs. Cluett gave me an excellent dinner and a
delightful bedroom, for I had to stay the night,
as my steamer was not due till next day. In
the evening I went to the service in the big
church on the hill. The congregation were
mostly men who "go down to the sea in ships
and occupy their business in great waters,"
while the special prayer for their protection
against the perils of cod fishing struck a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that was new to me. There was quite a nice
little organ and the whole congregation joined
devoutly in the hymns; altogether the service
was most impressive.</p>

<p>The <i>Glencoe</i> turned up at 1 o'clock on the
26th and the next afternoon we reached
Placentia, where the train was waiting. We
got away about 5.30, but did not reach St.
John's (80 miles) till 2 a.m. the following morning,
a very poor performance. The engine
could not pull us up the inclines. We made a
rush and each time stuck half-way and had to
run back a couple of miles to make a fresh try.
However, it seemed a usual occurrence, for
every one on board took it quite philosophically,
many recounting their reminiscences of
when they had to stop all night in the train.</p>

<p>In the train was Mr. Job, just returning from
a good grouse shoot. He told me he had in his
office a sixty-four pointer caribou stag shot by
an Indian and bought by his brother. He
very kindly allowed me to see it the next day,
and a very remarkable head it was; I could
make out at least sixty points.</p>

<p>I left St. John's at 6 p.m. on the 29th and
as we reached Gaff Topsails, about the highest
point of the railway, sleet and light snow were
falling and a bitter wind was blowing across
the open barrens. Descending to the Humber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Valley the climate became milder and the
autumn tints made the scenery, if possible,
more beautiful than when I had passed it
before. I had to spend Saturday night in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, but got away by the
Sunday night express and reached New York
early on Tuesday morning. It was still hot
and muggy and I was glad to leave on the
<i>Deutschland</i> on Saturday, October 8th, arriving
in Plymouth early on October 14th.</p>

<p>The route I had chosen involved great loss
of time, the weekly sailing of the <i>Glencoe</i> on the
south coast being a great drawback. If one
steamer be missed a week is lost.</p>

<p>I might just as well have gone from Port aux
Basques to Belleoram by steamer and returned
from Belleoram to Port aux Basques, thus
avoiding the tiresome railway journey of
twenty-nine hours, but I had to outfit at St.
John's and wished also to see the scenery of
the island.</p>

<p>The heads I got did not make up for a somewhat
expensive trip, but, on the other hand, I
had seen a great deal of very beautiful country
in fair comfort and enjoyed some excellent
trout fishing which I would not have got had I
gone in from the railway. I had the Mount
Sylvester country all to myself and it was
simply bad luck that I saw no good heads. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
can honestly say, however, that I never enjoyed
a hunting trip more, and only wish I could
look forward to another visit to the island, when
with my present experiences I could, I think,
make better arrangements to avoid loss of
time in reaching the hunting grounds.</p>

<p>The game laws of Newfoundland are sufficiently
liberal. A licence of $50 (£10) gives the
visitor the right to shoot three caribou stags.
The true sportsman should be content with
this limit and will carefully pick his heads.</p>

<p>The Newfoundlander, whether white man
or Indian, is not charged the $50. The Indian
certainly shoots what he wants and is not
particular about a close time. Accustomed
as he has been from time immemorial to range
the island and shoot for food and clothing, it
is difficult to get him to understand the principle
underlying game laws, and to accept a
game limit to which he has never been accustomed
and the necessity for which he does not
understand.</p>

<p>When the fishing laws come to be considered
there seems to me great room for improvement.
The Newfoundland Government prides itself
on all the rivers being open to every one. For
the first time, in 1910, a fishing licence of $10
was imposed on the visitor, and this gave him
the right to fish any river in the island. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
practical result is, that many of the best-known
rivers, such as the Codroy and Harry's Brook,
are overfished.</p>

<p>All the rivers on the west coast are very
accessible to the angler from the United States,
and suffer most from overcrowding. I met
an English angler who had been fishing the
Codroy; he said it was one continual struggle
as to who would get on to the water first. I
heard the same story at the south-east arm,
Placentia. The Government absolutely refuses
to lease a river or even to limit the number
of rods, and I think this policy is entirely
wrong.</p>

<p>In practice one may decide on a season in
Newfoundland. Having carefully selected a
somewhat inaccessible river and made all one's
arrangements for camping out, it would certainly
be disappointing on arrival to find two
or three other parties settled on the river and
one's trip spoiled, yet this is quite possible.
I was told in St. John's, no Government would
dare to change the existing law and the policy
of the open door in fishing. This I cannot
understand, for what has been done in Canada,
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia can surely
be done in Newfoundland.</p>

<p>The application of the law is carried to the
extreme. An official of the Fishery Board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
told me of a case where an American offered a
liberal rent for a remote river on the Labrador
Coast. There was but one settler on the river
and the American guaranteed that he would
take him into his service. He proposed to
build a fishing lodge and so put capital into the
country. His application was refused.</p>

<p>The Government professes to be most anxious
to encourage the tourist and sportsman to
visit the island, but I venture to think they are
not going the right way about it, at least as
regards the angler.</p>

<p>They do not seem to recognize the advantage
to the country of leasing any of the many
rivers. First the lessee would see that the
river was carefully preserved, he would give
employment to watchers, he would probably
build a house and in any case would spend
money in the country, while at the same time
his rent goes to increase the revenue.</p>

<p>A double object is thus attained&mdash;the preservation
of fish and game, and an increase in
revenue.</p>

<p>If, however, such a policy be impossible the
least the Government can do is to limit the
number of rods on each river and to have some
means of knowing which rivers are being fished
and by how many rods. In this way the angler
contemplating a trip to Newfoundland could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
apply for all information to the existing Fishery
Board, who would advise him where to go with
the least chance of being crowded out.</p>

<p>Given some such organization, Newfoundland
should become the favourite resort of the
British angler.</p>

<p>A hunting trip may be cheap or expensive,
chiefly depending on the route selected, the
number of Indians employed and the means of
transport in the island. The cheapest route
is by the direct steamers to St. John's. Two
Indians are sufficient, but a third adds greatly
to one's comfort. Their pay is&mdash;Headman,
2&frac12; to 3 dollars a day; other men, 2 dollars.
If a waterway into the interior be selected,
two canoes are a luxury, one large one a
necessity; with two canoes all the necessaries
and many of the luxuries of life can be enjoyed;
the same cannot be said of packing, as my
Vancouver experiences have shown. It is to
say the least a nuisance to have the necessaries
cut down; the luxuries, by which I mean preserved
milk, butter, jam, oatmeal, and a small
amount of whisky or rum, one can do without,
but why not be comfortable, if comfort can be
found, by the better mode of transport which
canoes afford.</p>

<p>They can be ordered from Canada through
Mr. Blair and sold on leaving the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>I give in an appendix my list of stores, but I
had far too much. One and a half stone of flour
is ample for four men for one week, the amount
taken will then depend on the length of the
trip. The cost as paid in St. John's is given.
I had many stores over, for we had abundance
of venison and fish.</p>

<p>Fish need never be wasted; the trout split,
salted and hung up over or near the camp fire
make excellent kippers, and when up on the
Shoe Hill Ridge, where no fresh fish were
obtainable, I thoroughly enjoyed the kippered
trout from Sandy Grove Pond.</p>
